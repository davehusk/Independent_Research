### **Introduction: The Core Argument**

The central thesis of this plan, the “Nullity and Restitution” doctrine, posits that the Canadian federal benefits system is built on a fundamental, systemic flaw. Every major benefit delivered through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) or Service Canada—from CERB and EI to the new Dental Care Plan—operates within a unified digital architecture that transforms the act of seeking help into an act of submitting to permanent surveillance.

This system is predicated on four core failures:

1. **Coerced Consent:** The "click-to-accept" model is performed under economic duress, where the alternative for citizens in crisis is destitution, rendering consent legally meaningless.1  
2. **System-Generated Error:** The "trust first, audit later" design, combined with vague and contradictory rules, makes errors and overpayments a direct, foreseeable result of the system's own negligence.5  
3. **Misplaced Liability:** Security failures and internal fraud, as identified in Auditor General (OAG) reports, are the responsibility of the state, yet the burden of proof and financial liability is shifted onto the citizen.10  
4. **Procedural Unfairness:** The process violates the principles of natural justice, as the same authority acts as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and enforcer, leaving citizens without a fair and independent venue to challenge demands.13

The foreseeable psychological harm caused by this "Digital Double Bind" is constitutionally relevant.17 Therefore, any resulting debt is legally null, and the state owes restitution to its citizens for the damages incurred. This plan outlines the research and actions required to substantiate and execute this doctrine.

### **Phase 1: Foundational Research & Evidence Gathering**

This phase focuses on assembling the official reports, public records, and legal precedents that form the evidentiary backbone of the argument.

#### **1.1 Official Audits and Critiques**

* **Auditor General (OAG) Reports:** We will compile and analyze all relevant OAG reports on COVID-19 benefits and government fraud risk management.  
  * **Key Evidence:** The OAG confirmed that overpayments of **$4.6 billion** were made to ineligible individuals and that an additional **$27.4 billion** in payments require further investigation.10 Reports also detail payments to deceased and incarcerated individuals, proving a lack of effective pre-payment controls.10 We will also draw on OAG findings that identify systemic weaknesses in fraud risk management across government departments, including inadequate employee training on ethics and conflicts of interest.11  
* **Privacy Commissioner Reports:** We will gather all reports, guidance, and statements from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) concerning the government's digital identity strategy.  
  * **Key Evidence:** The OPC has explicitly noted the federal government's pursuit of a "national approach to digital identity" and has been consulted on the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF).22 This confirms the "OneGC" strategy and the risk of "function creep," where data collected for one purpose is used to build a master citizen profile.22

#### **1.2 Contradictory Public Statements vs. Official Actions**

We will create a "Public Exhibit" file contrasting the government's reassuring public rhetoric with the harsh reality of its administrative actions.

* **Key Evidence:** This exhibit will juxtapose statements from the Prime Minister, such as telling Canadians "don't worry about it" regarding repayment letters over Christmas 24, with the aggressive post-payment verification process detailed on the CRA's website, which demands extensive documentation within tight deadlines.26 It will also highlight the confusion caused by shifting eligibility criteria, such as the "net vs. gross" income issue for self-employed applicants.24

#### **1.3 The Legal Framework**

We will build a legal case file grounded in established Canadian legal doctrines.

* **Procedural Fairness:** The argument will be anchored in the principles of *Baker v. Canada*, which outlines the factors determining the duty of fairness.13 We will demonstrate how the benefits system fails these tests, particularly through the lack of an impartial decision-maker and the denial of a meaningful right to be heard before clawbacks are initiated.15  
* **Reasonable Reliance & Estoppel:** We will argue that citizens reasonably relied on the government's statements, eligibility tools, and initial lack of scrutiny. This argument will draw on the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, as clarified in *Cowper-Smith v. Morgan*, and the defence of "officially induced error of law" from *R. v. Jorgensen*.24  
* **Coercion and Economic Duress:** We will establish that consent was vitiated by economic duress, as citizens had no practical alternative but to accept the terms to avoid destitution. This will reference Canadian contract law precedents that define duress as illegitimate pressure removing any effective choice.1

---

### **Phase 2: Building the Public Exhibit File**

This phase involves collecting the primary documents that illustrate the system's flawed architecture and its human cost.

#### **2.1 System Architecture Documentation**

* **Privacy Policies & Data Linkages:** We will collate the privacy notices for CRA MyAccount, My Service Canada Account, the Canada Child Benefit (CCB), the GST/HST Credit, and the Canadian Dental Care Plan.33 This will provide direct evidence of the broad consent clauses and the cross-departmental data sharing that underpins the "OneGC" surveillance network.50  
* **"Apply Now, Verify Later" Mechanics:** We will screenshot and archive the application portals and CRA validation pages that detail the post-payment verification process, which requires citizens to produce extensive documentation long after receiving funds.26

#### **2.2 Documenting Human Impact**

* **Personal Stories & Testimonies:** We will compile a comprehensive file of news reports and personal accounts detailing the stress, anxiety, and financial ruin caused by clawback notices.7 Stories of individuals receiving conflicting advice from different government departments or being held liable for fraud they did not commit will be prioritized.65  
* **Community Affidavits:** We will develop a template for community affidavits, allowing multiple individuals to tell the same story of systemic failure, thereby demonstrating that the harm is widespread and predictable, not isolated.

---

### **Phase 3: Developing Legal and Advocacy Tools**

This phase focuses on creating practical, actionable documents for legal challenges and policy reform.

#### **3.1 Draft Legal Templates**

* **Model Statement of Defence:** A template will be drafted for individuals or legal representatives to use when fighting a clawback or fraud charge. It will integrate the core arguments of coerced consent, system negligence, procedural unfairness, and reasonable reliance.  
* **Citizen's Declaration Template:** A plain-language declaration will be created for citizens to send to the CRA and their Member of Parliament. It will state: "I consented under duress; the information provided by the government was contradictory and confusing; the resulting debt is legally null. I demand the state expunge the surveillance record associated with this benefit and provide restitution for the time, stress, and privacy harm I have suffered."

#### **3.2 Draft Policy Submissions**

* **A "Debt Jubilee Act" Proposal:** A submission will be drafted for Parliament arguing for legislation to nullify all non-fraudulent debts arising from the flawed design of pandemic-era benefit programs.  
* **A Benefit Recipient Bill of Rights:** An outline for a new charter of rights will be created, guaranteeing clear and stable eligibility rules, the right to a hearing before an independent adjudicator prior to any clawback, and the right to unbundled, meaningful consent.  
* **An Independent Benefit Ombudsperson:** A proposal will be drafted for the creation of a new, independent ombudsperson with the power to investigate systemic issues and issue binding orders for both individual and systemic remedies.

---

### **Phase 4: Public Campaign & Policy Recommendations**

This final phase translates the research and legal arguments into a cohesive public campaign and a set of strategic policy demands.

#### **4.1 Core Campaign Messages**

* **"Nullify, Don't Claw Back":** A simple, powerful call to action demanding the erasure of all non-fraudulent debts, shifting the focus from individual "error" to systemic flaws.  
* **"Digital Consent Must Mean Consent":** A campaign to drive privacy reform, demanding an end to the bundling of consent and the automatic integration of citizen data into a permanent surveillance profile.

#### **4.2 Strategic Initiatives**

* **Class Action or Test Case:** We will build a coalition of affected individuals, legal aid clinics, and advocacy groups to launch a legal challenge that combines the arguments from administrative law, tort law, privacy law, and the Charter.  
* **Independent Forensic Audit:** We will publicly demand an independent, third-party forensic audit of benefit programs to trace insider misconduct and identity theft, ensuring that the blame for malicious fraud is placed on the state's failed security controls, not on innocent citizens whose identities were compromised.

### **Conclusion**

The evidence is clear and the legal foundation is sound. The Canadian government's digital benefit system, by its very design, creates a coercive paradox that violates the fundamental principles of fairness, privacy, and the social contract. The path forward is not to chase billions in system-generated "debt" from vulnerable citizens. The path forward is to acknowledge the state's culpability and act accordingly. As the core argument concludes: **What the citizen owes is null; what the state owes is trust, transparency, and restitution for every moment of stress and surveillance it inflicted by design.**
