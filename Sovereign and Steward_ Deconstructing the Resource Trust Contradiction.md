# **Sovereign and Steward: Deconstructing the Resource Trust Contradiction in Newfoundland and Labrador's Offshore**

### **Executive Summary**

The framework governing Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources is built on a series of structural contradictions that create a significant and quantifiable "trust deficit." This report deconstructs this deficit by examining the key points of failure in the system, from its legal foundations to its economic and governance realities.

The analysis begins by confirming the **legal fragility** of the province's resource control. Born from a Supreme Court loss and resolved through the political compromise of the *Atlantic Accord*, the province's status as "principal beneficiary" is perpetually qualified by the constitutional principle of federal paramountcy and the constraints of a joint management regime. This "simulated ownership" creates a foundation of inherent instability.

Next, the report **maps the economic flows**, revealing a stark disparity between public and private benefit. Provincial coffers receive volatile royalty revenues that are subject to partial clawbacks through the federal Equalization program. In contrast, multinational corporate partners secure vast and stable returns for global shareholders, calling into question who the "principal beneficiary" truly is in practice.

This is compounded by a fundamental **governance contradiction**. The offshore regulator, the C-NLOER, operates under a conflicted dual mandate to both promote resource extraction and police industry safety and environmental practices. This is further weakened by a systemic **transparency and oversight gap**. Access to information laws are limited by "commercial sensitivity" exemptions that shield key financial data from public scrutiny, while the Auditor General repeatedly identifies significant mismanagement and unaddressed liabilities, such as decommissioning costs, with recommendations that are not binding and often go unheeded.

When these formal channels fail, public pushback—exercised through the withdrawal of the "Social License to Operate"—is increasingly framed by the state not as democratic expression but as a **threat to "critical infrastructure."** This securitization of dissent, which involves surveillance and specialized policing of protest, completes a self-reinforcing cycle of conflict that erodes the very public trust necessary for stable resource governance. The result is a system where simulated ownership leads to a fragile benefit, which is diminished by corporate returns and federal clawbacks, hidden by secrecy, unchecked by effective oversight, and protected from dissent by securitization, creating a profound and growing trust deficit.

## **Part I: Confirming the Legal Fragility**

The framework governing Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources is not a simple grant of ownership but a complex, multi-layered political settlement. It is the product of a contentious history involving the foundational division of powers in Canadian federalism, a unique path to Confederation, a definitive legal defeat in the Supreme Court, and a subsequent political accord designed to simulate the benefits of ownership. This intricate architecture creates the initial conditions for the resource trust contradiction, embedding tension and fragility into the very foundation of the province's control over its most valuable natural asset.

### **1.1 The Division of Powers and Federal Paramountcy**

The constitutional basis for resource jurisdiction in Canada is rooted in the division of legislative powers outlined in the *Constitution Act, 1867*. Section 92 grants provincial legislatures exclusive authority over matters such as the management and sale of public lands belonging to the province and direct taxation for provincial purposes.1 Conversely, Section 91 grants the federal Parliament authority over matters of national scope, including trade and commerce and laws for the "Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada".2

This foundational division was significantly clarified and expanded with the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, which introduced Section 92A.3 This amendment was a landmark development for provincial resource rights, explicitly granting each provincial legislature exclusive authority to make laws concerning the exploration, development, conservation, and management of non-renewable natural resources and forestry resources within the province.4

However, this grant of "exclusive" power contains a critical and inherent contradiction. Section 92A(3) explicitly states that nothing in the provincial power over export derogates from the authority of the federal Parliament to enact laws on the same matter. In any instance where a provincial law and a federal law conflict, **the federal law prevails** to the extent of the conflict.1 This constitutional provision of

**federal paramountcy** immediately qualifies the notion of absolute provincial ownership, establishing a legal hierarchy that subordinates provincial export laws to federal jurisdiction over interprovincial and international trade. This structure institutionalizes a power imbalance, setting the stage for the federal-provincial struggles that would come to define the management of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources.

### **1.2 The Court Loss: Newfoundland's Unique Entry and the Offshore Dispute**

Newfoundland's journey into Confederation and its subsequent fight for resource control are distinct from those of other provinces. The *Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada, 1949*, the constitutional document that made Newfoundland Canada's tenth province, contained a provision that would become the focal point of a decades-long dispute.6 Term 37 of the agreement stipulated: "All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to Newfoundland at the date of Union... shall belong to the Province of Newfoundland".10 For years, the provincial government operated under the belief that this term secured its ownership of the vast mineral resources on its adjacent continental shelf.9

This belief was shattered in the 1980s. As the potential of offshore oil became apparent, the federal government, under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, asserted its own jurisdiction, citing a 1967 Supreme Court decision that had awarded seabed resources off British Columbia to the federal Crown.10 After years of failed negotiations, the dispute was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada. In a landmark 1984 ruling, the Court decided in Ottawa's favour, finding that Newfoundland did not have jurisdiction over the resources of the continental shelf at the time of Union in 1949 and therefore could not have brought them into Confederation under Term 37\.10 This legal defeat was a pivotal moment, viewed within the province as a profound breach of the original spirit of the Confederation agreement and a direct denial of what it considered its birthright.

### **1.3 The Political Fix: The Atlantic Accord and "Simulated Ownership"**

The 1984 Supreme Court decision created a political crisis that demanded a political solution. The result was the 1985 *Canada-Newfoundland Atlantic Accord*, a memorandum of agreement that stands as a cornerstone of the province's modern political economy.10 The Accord is not a simple management agreement; it is a carefully constructed compromise designed to grant Newfoundland and Labrador the practical benefits of resource ownership without the legal title. Its stated purposes reveal this dual objective: to develop offshore resources for the "benefit of Canada as a whole and Newfoundland and Labrador in particular," while simultaneously recognizing the province's right to be the

**"principal beneficiary"** of the resources off its shores.11

This political settlement was codified through mirror federal and provincial legislation, principally the *Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*.13 This legislation operationalizes the compromise by establishing a

**joint management** regime, embodied by the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), now the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Energy Regulator (C-NLOER).13 The Board, with members appointed by both federal and provincial governments, is tasked with administering all petroleum-related activities in the offshore area.11 This structure allows the province to establish and collect resource revenues "as if these resources were on land," simulating ownership.11

The entire legal and political framework, therefore, rests on a foundation of "simulated ownership." The province acts as the primary manager and beneficiary, but this power is ultimately delegated and constrained by the joint-management structure and the ever-present constitutional authority of the federal government.1 This is not a stable foundation built on clear title but a pragmatic, yet inherently fragile, political truce. Any federal action perceived as overreach—whether related to environmental assessments, equalization payments, or other policy areas—is thus interpreted not merely as a policy dispute, but as a potential breach of the fundamental trust upon which the entire Accord regime is built. The recent expansion of the Accord Acts to include offshore renewable energy reinforces this model, extending the joint-sovereignty framework and its core contradictions into the next generation of energy development.16

| Year | Event/Document | Key Provision/Outcome | Significance for NL's Resource Control |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1949 | *Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada* | Term 37: "All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to Newfoundland at the date of Union... shall belong to the Province of Newfoundland." 10 | Established the basis for the province's long-held belief in its ownership of offshore resources. |
| 1982 | *Constitution Act, 1982* | Section 92A: Grants provinces "exclusive" jurisdiction over resource management but preserves federal paramountcy over export. 3 | Constitutionally affirmed provincial resource rights on land but embedded a federal-provincial power dynamic. |
| 1984 | *Supreme Court of Canada Offshore Reference* | Ruled that Newfoundland did not have jurisdiction over offshore resources at the time of Union; ownership vested with the federal Crown. 10 | Legally invalidated the province's claim to offshore ownership, creating a political crisis and a deep sense of grievance. |
| 1985 | *Canada-Newfoundland Atlantic Accord MOU* | Established joint management and declared NL the "principal beneficiary," allowing it to collect revenues "as if" it owned the resources. 10 | Created a political solution to the legal defeat, establishing the framework of "simulated ownership" as a compromise. |
| 1987 | *Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* | Codified the Accord, creating the C-NLOPB and the detailed rules for joint management, revenue sharing, and regulation. 13 | Operationalized the political compromise into a durable, but complex and inherently contradictory, legislative regime. |
| 2023-2025 | *Accord Act Amendments for Renewables* | Expanded the mandate of the Accord Acts and the C-NLOER to include regulation of offshore renewable energy, like wind power. 13 | Reaffirmed and extended the joint-management model, perpetuating the "simulated ownership" framework for the future energy economy. |

## **Part II: Mapping the Economic Flows**

The contradiction between the state's role as economic promoter and public steward is not merely a legal or social abstraction; it is manifested in the quantifiable economic outcomes of the offshore industry. An analysis of provincial finances, federal transfer payments, and corporate profits reveals a significant gap between the political promise of the Atlantic Accord and the economic reality for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. This discrepancy fuels the trust deficit by demonstrating how the distribution of financial benefits fails to align with the foundational principle that the province would be the "principal beneficiary" of its resources.

### **2.1 Provincial Coffers and Volatile Royalty Revenues**

Newfoundland and Labrador's public finances are deeply dependent on the volatile revenues generated by its offshore oil industry. Provincial budgets and public accounts consistently show that offshore royalties constitute a major source of income, funding a significant portion of public services like health care and education.19 For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, for example, offshore royalties amounted to $904.5 million.21 However, this reliance has also exposed the province to the classic symptoms of the "resource curse," including extreme revenue volatility tied to global oil prices and a high-risk budgeting strategy.22 In 2021-22, offshore revenues accounted for nearly 19% of the province's own-source revenues; a projected decline in production threatens to create a massive fiscal hole.19 This volatility was evident in the 2023-24 fiscal year, when actual royalties fell $195.9 million short of the budget, primarily due to lower-than-expected oil prices and production.21

This fiscal vulnerability is compounded by unresolved accounting issues that call into question the true net benefit of the resources. The Auditor General of Newfoundland and Labrador has repeatedly issued recommendations, which remain outstanding, urging the government to properly determine and account for the impact of future decommissioning costs on offshore royalties.24 This failure to account for massive end-of-life liabilities suggests that the net revenues reported by the province may be overstated, masking the true long-term costs. Furthermore, the initial development of major projects like Hibernia and Terra Nova required significant public financial support, including over $1 billion in capital contributions and $1.66 billion in loan guarantees for Hibernia, and over $500 million in financial assistance for the Terra Nova life extension.25 These contributions, royalty concessions, and unresolved liabilities complicate the narrative of a simple revenue stream and raise critical questions about the actual net value captured by the public.

### **2.2 Corporate Benefit vs. Public Good: A Financial Accounting**

A quantitative analysis of revenue flows reveals a stark contrast between the benefits accruing to the public and those captured by the multinational corporations operating offshore. The "principal beneficiary" clause of the Atlantic Accord, a politically powerful promise, becomes economically ambiguous when subjected to financial scrutiny. While the province receives substantial revenues, these are volatile and partially offset by reductions in federal transfers. In contrast, the corporate partners in the offshore projects generate massive, stable profits that translate into significant returns for their global shareholders.

For the 2023 fiscal or reporting year, a comparison is illustrative. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador received approximately $904.5 million in offshore royalties.21 Payments reported under the

*Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act* (ESTMA) show Suncor paid the province $192.8 million in royalties and ExxonMobil paid $184.8 million in taxes and fees.28 During the same period, the global financial performance of these parent companies was immense. ExxonMobil reported a net income of $36 billion and distributed $32.4 billion to shareholders.30 Chevron reported a net income of $21.4 billion and returned $26.3 billion to shareholders.31 Suncor reported net earnings of $8.3 billion and returned $5.0 billion to its shareholders.32

This juxtaposition suggests that while the province is a beneficiary, it is arguably not the *principal* one in terms of the scale and stability of financial returns. This economic reality, when set against a backdrop of high household debt and rising energy costs for the province's citizens 33, fuels the trust deficit. The gap between the political narrative of the Accord and the tangible economic outcomes creates a powerful sense that the public good is secondary to private corporate profit.

| Revenue Flow Analysis \- Offshore NL (Fiscal Year 2023\) |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

### **2.3 The Federal Clawback: The Equalization Paradox**

The complex interplay between provincial resource revenues and the federal Equalization program introduces another layer of economic contradiction. The Equalization program, enshrined in the Constitution, is a federal transfer payment designed to ensure that all provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide "reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation".37 It addresses horizontal fiscal imbalances by providing unconditional payments to provinces with below-average revenue-raising capacity.40

The treatment of non-renewable resource revenues within this formula is a major point of contention. Since 2007 reforms, the formula allows eligible provinces to choose whether to have 50% of their resource revenues included in the calculation or to have them excluded entirely, whichever yields a larger payment.42 This creates a fundamental paradox: as a province's resource revenues rise, its Equalization payments from the federal government fall.44 This "clawback" is a source of intense federal-provincial friction. From the perspective of a province like Newfoundland and Labrador, it feels like a penalty for developing its resources, directly undermining the spirit of the Atlantic Accord's promise to make it the "principal beneficiary".46 For years, the province's oil wealth made it ineligible for Equalization, a status celebrated in 2008 but lamented by critics who argued the formula was unfair.47 The province only recently began receiving payments again, receiving a modest $218 million for 2024-25, the smallest payment among recipient provinces.46 Projections suggest that future projects like Bay du Nord could once again eliminate the province's eligibility, reinforcing the perception that the federal system reclaims a portion of the benefits that were supposed to accrue primarily to the province.19

## **Part III: Exposing the Governance Contradiction**

The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), recently renamed the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Energy Regulator (C-NLOER), operates on a legislative tightrope, balancing two fundamentally conflicting roles.15 On one hand, the Board is mandated to promote resource development. Its activities, detailed in annual reports and official statistics, include issuing calls for bids for exploration parcels, granting exploration and production licenses, and approving development plans—all functions aimed at facilitating and expanding industrial activity in the offshore.11

On the other hand, the Accord Acts state that the Board's paramount responsibilities are the safety of offshore workers and the protection of the environment.49 Its regulatory functions include conducting safety audits, investigating environmental incidents, and enforcing compliance with operational standards.49 This dual mandate creates an inherent conflict of interest. The pressure to attract investment and maximize production for the economic benefit of both levels of government can run directly counter to the need for stringent, precautionary regulation. Every decision—from approving a development plan to responding to a spill—is made within this conflicted space, creating a persistent risk that the promotional imperative could compromise its paramount duties of safety and environmental stewardship.

## **Part IV: Testing the Transparency Limit**

The primary mechanisms for public accountability are significantly hampered in their ability to provide effective oversight of the offshore sector. The provincial *Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015* (ATIPPA) grants the public a right to access government records but contains broad exceptions that limit its effectiveness.53 Part II, Division 2 of the Act outlines numerous exceptions, including for Cabinet confidences and, most critically for the resource sector, information that could be "harmful to the business interests of a third party".54 This "commercial sensitivity" exemption can be used to shield the financial details of royalty agreements, government support packages, and project economics from public view, preventing a full accounting of the deals being struck in the public's name.55 A review of completed ATIPP requests reveals numerous inquiries related to oil and gas projects, but the extent of disclosure is often limited by these very exceptions.57

## **Part V: Pinning the Oversight Loop**

The Auditor General of Newfoundland and Labrador provides a potent, independent check on government. However, recent reports demonstrate a pattern of significant findings followed by a lack of meaningful action. The June 2024 audit of the Oil and Gas Corporation (OilCo) uncovered serious issues, including the payment of excessive salaries to former Nalcor employees, failure to follow government procurement rules, and a persistent refusal to classify its positions as directed by government.59 Similarly, the 2024 audit of the province's public accounts reiterated a multi-year, outstanding recommendation that the government has failed to properly account for future offshore decommissioning costs—a liability that could significantly impact future royalty revenues.24 The persistent failure to implement these crucial recommendations signals a significant breakdown in the accountability loop, where independent oversight identifies serious problems but the government entities responsible fail to act.61

| Accountability and Oversight \- Key Auditor General Findings |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Report** | **Key Finding/Recommendation** | **Entity's Response** | **Status** |
| June 2024 OilCo Audit | **Recommendation:** OilCo should classify its positions on government scales, as directed by government. | **Rejection:** OilCo stated it would pursue a market-based compensation system, a proposal previously rejected by government. 59 | Outstanding \- OilCo refused to accept the recommendation. 59 |
| June 2024 OilCo Audit | **Finding:** Failure to solicit open bids for costly financial services contracts, contrary to government procurement policy. | **Acceptance:** OilCo stated it would work with the Public Procurement Agency to ensure compliance. 59 | Action Promised |
| 2024 Financial Statement Audit | **Recommendation:** Government should conclude its work to determine the impact of the carry-back of expected decommissioning costs on offshore royalties. | **No firm commitment:** Government indicated it was still working with the department to obtain information from operators. 24 | Outstanding \- Repeated recommendation from prior years. 24 |

## **Part VI: Tracing How Pushback Becomes a Threat**

A significant contradiction in Canadian resource law emerges from the ambiguous legal status of public trust. While the law recognizes a strong, enforceable fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples regarding their lands and resources, no equivalent, legally binding trust exists for the general population.63 In the vacuum created by this legal asymmetry, the non-binding concept of a "Social License to Operate" (SLO) has emerged as a powerful, de facto measure of public trust.66

Coined in the 1990s, SLO refers to the ongoing level of acceptance or approval that local communities and stakeholders grant to a company's projects.66 It is a factual, not a legal, concept; a project can have all necessary legal permits but lack a social license.66 When communities perceive that governments and corporations are not acting in their best interests, they can withdraw the SLO through protests, blockades, and legal challenges, which can impose significant costs on projects.66 Research from Memorial University has highlighted a public misconception that offshore benefits are limited to government revenues concentrated in St. John's, indicating a fragile base of public support that can easily be withdrawn.70

When these formal channels for accountability fail, public discontent inevitably spills into the extra-legal realm of protest. The state's response to this dissent reveals the sharpest edge of the resource trust contradiction. Through federal bodies like Public Safety Canada, energy and transportation networks have been designated as "critical infrastructure," a classification that reframes opposition to resource projects not as legitimate democratic expression, but as a potential threat to national security and economic well-being.71

This "securitization" of dissent provides justification for heightened surveillance and policing. While the most prominent examples come from British Columbia, internal RCMP reports and watchdog investigations reveal a national strategy. Documents show RCMP national security units monitoring First Nations-led anti-pipeline activism for "potential threats," creating profiles of peaceful demonstrators, and sharing information with private corporations.73 This strategy is operationalized through specialized units like the RCMP's Community-Industry Response Group (C-IRG), a controversial group formed in 2017 specifically to police protests against resource extraction projects.76 The C-IRG has been accused of using militarized tactics, intimidation, and excessive force to enforce corporate injunctions against land defenders.79

This system demonstrates a stark inversion of accountability. Instead of public bodies and corporations being held accountable to the public for their management of shared resources, the members of the public who demand that accountability become the subjects of state surveillance and policing. The trust deficit is managed not through reform and reconciliation, but through security and enforcement, confirming the public's worst fears that the state is acting as a protector of industry rather than as a steward of the public interest. While the C-IRG has not been documented as operating in Newfoundland and Labrador, the existence of this national policing model for resource conflicts poses a critical question for the province's future as it navigates its own energy transition and the inevitable social conflicts that will arise.

## **Part VII: Synthesis: The Self-Reinforcing Contradiction**

The governance of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources is defined by a self-reinforcing loop of contradiction that systematically erodes public trust. The process can be mapped as follows:

* **Simulated Ownership:** The entire structure rests on the fragile legal foundation of the *Atlantic Accord*, a political fix that grants the province the benefits of ownership without the title, perpetually constrained by federal paramountcy and joint management.10  
* **Fragile Benefit & Volatile Cash:** This leads to a fragile benefit for the province, characterized by volatile royalty revenues that are highly susceptible to global price shocks and production declines.21  
* **Stable Corporate Cut & Federal Clawback:** This volatile public revenue stream contrasts sharply with the stable, large-scale profits returned to multinational corporate shareholders.30 Furthermore, any provincial gains are partially offset by the federal Equalization formula, which "claws back" a portion of the benefit, creating a disincentive for resource development.44  
* **Secrecy & Oversight Gap:** The public's ability to scrutinize this economic arrangement is limited. Access to information laws contain "commercial sensitivity" exemptions that can shield key financial details from view.54 At the same time, independent oversight from the Auditor General identifies significant mismanagement and unaddressed liabilities, but the recommendations are not binding and often go unimplemented for years.24  
* **Dissent & Securitization:** With formal channels for accountability proving ineffective, public discontent manifests as protest and the withdrawal of the "Social License to Operate".66 The state, in turn, frames this dissent not as a symptom of a broken trust but as a security risk to "critical infrastructure," justifying surveillance and specialized policing.71  
* **Trust Deficit:** This final step completes the cycle. The securitization of dissent confirms the public's perception that the state prioritizes corporate interests over public stewardship, validating the initial distrust and deepening the chasm between the political promise of the Accord and the lived reality of its outcomes.

## **Conclusion: Breaking the Loop**

The structural contradictions inherent in the management of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources raise a series of fundamental questions for which the current system has no easy answers:

* Who enforces the province’s benefit when the federal level can override it?  
* Who actually gets the benefit first—the people or the corporations?  
* Who holds the true ownership title when push comes to shove?  
* Who protects the public's right to check the ledger when secrecy is invoked?  
* Who holds the regulator accountable when it polices itself?  
* Who listens to oversight bodies when their recommendations are ignored?  
* Who protects peaceful pushback when dissent is surveilled?

This system places the Crown in the conflicting roles of **Sovereign** and **Steward**. As Sovereign, it holds the ultimate power to override the benefit promised to the province. As Steward, it claims to manage the resource for the public good. The core contradiction is that the same entity cannot fully perform both roles when each one undermines the other.

Breaking this self-reinforcing loop and closing the trust deficit requires rebuilding the structure so that the promise of "principal beneficiary" has legal and practical teeth. Practical proposals to achieve this include:

1. **Make the trust legally enforceable** by enacting a provincial Public Trust Act to create a clear, actionable duty for the government to manage resources for the public's long-term benefit.  
2. **Make the regulator independent and conflict-free** by structurally separating its promotional and regulatory functions into distinct bodies.  
3. **Make financial flows fully transparent** by amending access to information laws to narrow the "commercial sensitivity" exemption for resource development agreements.  
4. **Cap how much benefit can be clawed back** by reforming the federal Equalization formula to eliminate the penalty against provincial resource revenues.  
5. **Guarantee protest is not framed as a threat by default** by developing national policing standards that prioritize Charter rights and de-escalation over a securitized "critical infrastructure" framework.

Without such fundamental reforms, the province is destined to remain in a state of perpetual "simulated ownership" while the trust deficit continues to grow.
