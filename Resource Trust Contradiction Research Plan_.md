# **Sovereign and Steward: Deconstructing the Resource Trust Contradiction in Newfoundland and Labrador's Offshore**

### **Executive Summary**

The legal, economic, and governance frameworks for Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore oil and gas sector are built upon a fundamental contradiction between the state's role as an economic promoter and its duty as a public trustee. This report argues that this inherent tension has created a quantifiable "trust deficit," evidenced by persistent fiscal instability, federal-provincial friction, public opposition to resource development, and the securitization of dissent. The legal architecture, born from a constitutional dispute and settled through a political compromise known as the Atlantic Accord, grants the province the benefits of ownership without the full legal title, creating a fragile "simulated ownership" dependent on federal goodwill. In the absence of a legally enforceable public trust for the general population—unlike the well-established fiduciary duty owed to Indigenous peoples—the concept of a "Social License to Operate" has emerged as a de facto, yet volatile, measure of public confidence.

This trust deficit is exacerbated by economic realities. The promise that Newfoundland and Labrador would be the "principal beneficiary" of its offshore resources is challenged by a fiscal regime where provincial royalty revenues are subject to volatility and partial clawbacks through the federal Equalization program, while multinational corporations secure vast and stable returns for shareholders. Furthermore, governance and accountability mechanisms are compromised. The offshore regulator holds a conflicting mandate to both promote and police the industry, while transparency tools like access to information legislation are constrained by commercial sensitivity exemptions. Independent audits by the Auditor General have revealed significant mismanagement and a lack of follow-through on key recommendations, particularly concerning the provincial oil and gas corporation and the accounting of future decommissioning costs. When these formal channels fail, public discontent manifests as protest, which is increasingly framed by the state not as democratic expression but as a threat to "critical infrastructure," leading to a cycle of surveillance and conflict that further erodes public trust. This report deconstructs these interconnected contradictions and concludes with a series of legal, fiscal, and governance reforms aimed at reconciling the state's dual roles and rebuilding a durable foundation of public trust.

## **Part I: The Constitutional and Contractual Architecture of Resource Control**

The framework governing Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources is not a simple grant of ownership but a complex, multi-layered political settlement. It is the product of a contentious history involving the foundational division of powers in Canadian federalism, a unique path to Confederation, a definitive legal defeat in the Supreme Court, and a subsequent political accord designed to simulate the benefits of ownership. This intricate architecture creates the initial conditions for the resource trust contradiction, embedding tension and fragility into the very foundation of the province's control over its most valuable natural asset.

### **1.1 The Division of Powers: From Confederation to Constitutional Amendment**

The constitutional basis for resource jurisdiction in Canada is rooted in the division of legislative powers outlined in the *Constitution Act, 1867*. Section 92 grants provincial legislatures exclusive authority over matters such as the management and sale of public lands belonging to the province and direct taxation for provincial purposes.1 Conversely, Section 91 grants the federal Parliament authority over matters of national scope, including trade and commerce and laws for the "Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada".2

This foundational division was significantly clarified and expanded with the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, which introduced Section 92A.3 This amendment was a landmark development for provincial resource rights, explicitly granting each provincial legislature exclusive authority to make laws concerning the exploration, development, conservation, and management of non-renewable natural resources and forestry resources within the province.4

However, this grant of "exclusive" power contains a critical and inherent contradiction. Section 92A(3) explicitly states that nothing in the provincial power over export derogates from the authority of the federal Parliament to enact laws on the same matter. In any instance where a provincial law and a federal law conflict, the federal law prevails.1 This constitutional provision of federal paramountcy immediately qualifies the notion of absolute provincial ownership, establishing a legal hierarchy that subordinates provincial export laws to federal jurisdiction over interprovincial and international trade. This structure institutionalizes a power imbalance, setting the stage for the federal-provincial struggles that would come to define the management of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources.

### **1.2 Newfoundland's Unique Entry: The Terms of Union and the Offshore Dispute**

Newfoundland's journey into Confederation and its subsequent fight for resource control are distinct from those of other provinces. The *Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada, 1949*, the constitutional document that made Newfoundland Canada's tenth province, contained a provision that would become the focal point of a decades-long dispute.6 Term 37 of the agreement stipulated: "All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to Newfoundland at the date of Union... shall belong to the Province of Newfoundland".10 For years, the provincial government operated under the belief that this term secured its ownership of the vast mineral resources on its adjacent continental shelf.9

This belief was shattered in the 1980s. As the potential of offshore oil became apparent, the federal government, under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, asserted its own jurisdiction, citing a 1967 Supreme Court decision that had awarded seabed resources off British Columbia to the federal Crown.10 After years of failed negotiations, the dispute was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada. In a landmark 1984 ruling, the Court decided in Ottawa's favour, finding that Newfoundland did not have jurisdiction over the resources of the continental shelf at the time of Union in 1949 and therefore could not have brought them into Confederation under Term 37\.10 This legal defeat was a pivotal moment, viewed within the province as a profound breach of the original spirit of the Confederation agreement and a direct denial of what it considered its birthright.

### **1.3 The Atlantic Accord Regime: A Political Solution to a Legal Defeat**

The 1984 Supreme Court decision created a political crisis that demanded a political solution. The result was the 1985 *Canada-Newfoundland Atlantic Accord*, a memorandum of agreement that stands as a cornerstone of the province's modern political economy.10 The Accord is not a simple management agreement; it is a carefully constructed compromise designed to grant Newfoundland and Labrador the practical benefits of resource ownership without the legal title. Its stated purposes reveal this dual objective: to develop offshore resources for the "benefit of Canada as a whole and Newfoundland and Labrador in particular," while simultaneously recognizing the province's right to be the "principal beneficiary" of the resources off its shores.11

This political settlement was codified through mirror federal and provincial legislation, principally the *Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*.13 This legislation operationalizes the compromise by establishing a joint management regime, embodied by the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), now the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Energy Regulator (C-NLOER).13 The Board, with members appointed by both federal and provincial governments, is tasked with administering all petroleum-related activities in the offshore area.11 This structure allows the province to establish and collect resource revenues "as if these resources were on land," simulating ownership.11

The entire legal and political framework, therefore, rests on a foundation of "simulated ownership." The province acts as the primary manager and beneficiary, but this power is ultimately delegated and constrained by the joint-management structure and the ever-present constitutional authority of the federal government.1 This is not a stable foundation built on clear title but a pragmatic, yet inherently fragile, political truce. Any federal action perceived as overreach—whether related to environmental assessments, equalization payments, or other policy areas—is thus interpreted not merely as a policy dispute, but as a potential breach of the fundamental trust upon which the entire Accord regime is built. The recent expansion of the Accord Acts to include offshore renewable energy reinforces this model, extending the joint-sovereignty framework and its core contradictions into the next generation of energy development.16

| Year | Event/Document | Key Provision/Outcome | Significance for NL's Resource Control |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1949 | *Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada* | Term 37: "All lands, mines, minerals, and royalties belonging to Newfoundland at the date of Union... shall belong to the Province of Newfoundland." 10 | Established the basis for the province's long-held belief in its ownership of offshore resources. |
| 1982 | *Constitution Act, 1982* | Section 92A: Grants provinces "exclusive" jurisdiction over resource management but preserves federal paramountcy over export. 3 | Constitutionally affirmed provincial resource rights on land but embedded a federal-provincial power dynamic. |
| 1984 | *Supreme Court of Canada Offshore Reference* | Ruled that Newfoundland did not have jurisdiction over offshore resources at the time of Union; ownership vested with the federal Crown. 10 | Legally invalidated the province's claim to offshore ownership, creating a political crisis and a deep sense of grievance. |
| 1985 | *Canada-Newfoundland Atlantic Accord MOU* | Established joint management and declared NL the "principal beneficiary," allowing it to collect revenues "as if" it owned the resources. 10 | Created a political solution to the legal defeat, establishing the framework of "simulated ownership" as a compromise. |
| 1987 | *Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* | Codified the Accord, creating the C-NLOPB and the detailed rules for joint management, revenue sharing, and regulation. 13 | Operationalized the political compromise into a durable, but complex and inherently contradictory, legislative regime. |
| 2023-2025 | *Accord Act Amendments for Renewables* | Expanded the mandate of the Accord Acts and the C-NLOER to include regulation of offshore renewable energy, like wind power. 13 | Reaffirmed and extended the joint-management model, perpetuating the "simulated ownership" framework for the future energy economy. |

## **Part II: The Ambiguous Nature of "Trust" in Canadian Resource Law**

While the constitutional architecture establishes a framework of shared and contested power, the concept of "trust" provides the normative lens through which this framework is judged by the public. A significant contradiction emerges from the ambiguous legal status of this trust. Canadian law recognizes a strong, enforceable fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Indigenous peoples regarding their lands and resources. However, no equivalent, legally binding trust exists for the general population. In the vacuum created by this legal asymmetry, the non-binding concept of a "Social License to Operate" has emerged as a powerful, de facto measure of public trust, creating new arenas for conflict and exposing the state's contradictory roles as both steward and sovereign.

### **2.1 The Crown's Fiduciary Duty: A Duty to Whom?**

In Canadian law, the concept of the Crown's fiduciary duty is most robustly and clearly defined in its relationship with Indigenous peoples. Beginning with the landmark Supreme Court of Canada decision in *Guerin v. The Queen* (1984), the courts have established that the Crown owes a *sui generis* (unique) fiduciary duty when dealing with lands surrendered by Indigenous bands.19 This duty is not merely political or moral, but is an equitable obligation, enforceable in court, that requires the Crown to act in the best interests of the Indigenous people whose interests it controls.19 This obligation arises from the historical context of the Crown asserting control over Aboriginal peoples and their interests, creating a relationship of dependency and responsibility.20

In sharp contrast, the Crown's duty to the general Canadian public regarding the management of natural resources is far more nebulous. Legal scholars and judicial decisions have generally characterized this broader obligation as political or moral in nature, rather than a legally enforceable fiduciary one.19 While governments have a public law duty to govern in the public interest, this does not typically translate into the kind of specific, actionable fiduciary obligation that exists in the Crown-Aboriginal relationship.20 This legal asymmetry is a critical component of the resource trust contradiction: one group of citizens has a recognized, enforceable trust relationship with the Crown over resources, while the broader population does not, leaving them with fewer formal legal avenues to hold the government to account as a trustee.

### **2.2 The Public Trust Doctrine: An Unfulfilled Promise?**

A potential legal basis for a broader public trust over natural resources is the Public Trust Doctrine (PTD). With origins in Roman law and English common law, the PTD posits that the sovereign holds certain essential, common resources—such as navigable waters, the air, and the sea—in trust for the benefit of the people.22 The core premise is that these resources are "too important to society to be owned by one person" and that the state, as trustee, is prohibited from alienating them for private control and must manage them for public uses like navigation, fishing, and recreation.22

Despite its conceptual power, the PTD has not taken firm root in Canadian case law.22 The Supreme Court of Canada considered the doctrine in its 2004 decision in

*British Columbia v. Canadian Forest Products Ltd.* (*Canfor*). While the Court acknowledged the doctrine's historical lineage and recognized that a healthy environment is a "Canadian value," it ultimately did not explicitly incorporate the PTD into Canadian common law.22 Subsequent cases, such as

*Burns Bog Conservation Society v. Canada*, have seen lower courts explicitly note that no Canadian court has yet recognized the PTD.22 Consequently, while the PTD is frequently invoked by environmental advocates and legal scholars as a tool for protecting ecological values and ensuring government accountability, it remains an unfulfilled promise in Canadian jurisprudence.22 It provides a powerful normative argument but lacks the legal teeth to serve as a strong, enforceable check on government decisions regarding resource extraction.

### **2.3 Social License to Operate: The De Facto Trust**

Into the legal vacuum left by the absence of an enforceable fiduciary duty or a robust Public Trust Doctrine for the general populace, the concept of "Social License to Operate" (SLO) has emerged as a potent, non-legal substitute.24 Coined in the mining industry in the 1990s, SLO refers to the ongoing level of acceptance or approval that local communities and other stakeholders grant to a company's projects and operations.24 It is a factual, not a legal, concept; a project can have all necessary legal permits but lack a social license.24

The SLO functions as a direct, real-world manifestation of public trust. When communities perceive that governments and corporations are not acting in their best interests—breaching the implicit moral trust—they can withdraw the SLO. This withdrawal is expressed through protests, blockades, consumer boycotts, and legal challenges, which can impose significant delays, reputational damage, and financial costs on projects, sometimes jeopardizing their viability.24 In Newfoundland and Labrador, the conditions for SLO challenges are particularly fertile. Research from Memorial University has highlighted a common misconception among the public that the benefits of the offshore industry are limited to government revenues and are concentrated in St. John's, indicating a lack of broad-based awareness and buy-in that can easily curdle into distrust.28 This dynamic places corporations and governments in a position where they must continuously earn and maintain this intangible public trust to ensure operational stability, effectively treating SLO as the de facto trust that the law does not formally provide.

The absence of a legally recognized public trust does not, therefore, eliminate the public's expectation of one. This expectation is asserted through the granting or withdrawal of the Social License to Operate. When state and corporate actions, driven by economic mandates, conflict with public expectations for environmental protection and equitable benefit sharing, the SLO is withdrawn, leading to social and political conflict. The state, in turn, often interprets this conflict not as a symptom of a broken trust but as a security threat to its economic interests. This framing justifies the deployment of the state's security apparatus to monitor and police its own citizens, which is perceived by those citizens as proof that the state is protecting corporate interests over public ones. This perception validates their initial distrust and fuels a self-reinforcing cycle of protest, securitization, and deepening social division, further eroding the very trust necessary for stable resource governance.

## **Part III: The Economic Manifestation of Contradiction**

The contradiction between the state's role as economic promoter and public steward is not merely a legal or social abstraction; it is manifested in the quantifiable economic outcomes of the offshore industry. An analysis of provincial finances, federal transfer payments, and corporate profits reveals a significant gap between the political promise of the Atlantic Accord and the economic reality for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. This discrepancy fuels the trust deficit by demonstrating how the distribution of financial benefits fails to align with the foundational principle that the province would be the "principal beneficiary" of its resources.

### **3.1 Provincial Coffers and the Royalty Dilemma**

Newfoundland and Labrador's public finances are deeply dependent on the volatile revenues generated by its offshore oil industry. Provincial budgets and public accounts consistently show that offshore royalties constitute a major source of income, funding a significant portion of public services like health care and education.29 For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, for example, offshore royalties amounted to $904.5 million.31 However, this reliance has also exposed the province to the classic symptoms of the "resource curse," including extreme revenue volatility tied to global oil prices and a high-risk budgeting strategy.32 In 2021-22, offshore revenues accounted for nearly 19% of the province's own-source revenues; a projected decline in production threatens to create a massive fiscal hole.29 This volatility was evident in the 2023-24 fiscal year, when actual royalties fell $195.9 million short of the budget, primarily due to lower-than-expected oil prices and production.31

This fiscal vulnerability is compounded by unresolved accounting issues that call into question the true net benefit of the resources. The Auditor General of Newfoundland and Labrador has repeatedly issued recommendations, which remain outstanding, urging the government to properly determine and account for the impact of future decommissioning costs on offshore royalties.34 This failure to account for massive end-of-life liabilities suggests that the net revenues reported by the province may be overstated, masking the true long-term costs. Furthermore, the initial development of major projects like Hibernia and Terra Nova required significant public financial support, including over $1 billion in capital contributions and $1.66 billion in loan guarantees for Hibernia, and over $500 million in financial assistance for the Terra Nova life extension.35 These contributions, royalty concessions, and unresolved liabilities complicate the narrative of a simple revenue stream and raise critical questions about the actual net value captured by the public.

### **3.2 The Equalization Paradox: Penalized for Prosperity?**

The complex interplay between provincial resource revenues and the federal Equalization program introduces another layer of economic contradiction. The Equalization program, enshrined in the Constitution, is a federal transfer payment designed to ensure that all provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide "reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation".38 It addresses horizontal fiscal imbalances by providing unconditional payments to provinces with below-average revenue-raising capacity.41

The treatment of non-renewable resource revenues within this formula is a major point of contention. Since 2007 reforms, the formula allows eligible provinces to choose whether to have 50% of their resource revenues included in the calculation or to have them excluded entirely, whichever yields a larger payment.43 This creates a fundamental paradox: as a province's resource revenues rise, its Equalization payments from the federal government fall.45 This "clawback" is a source of intense federal-provincial friction. From the perspective of a province like Newfoundland and Labrador, it feels like a penalty for developing its resources, directly undermining the spirit of the Atlantic Accord's promise to make it the "principal beneficiary".47 For years, the province's oil wealth made it ineligible for Equalization, a status celebrated in 2008 but lamented by critics who argued the formula was unfair.48 The province only recently began receiving payments again, receiving a modest $218 million for 2024-25, the smallest payment among recipient provinces.47 Projections suggest that future projects like Bay du Nord could once again eliminate the province's eligibility, reinforcing the perception that the federal system reclaims a portion of the benefits that were supposed to accrue primarily to the province.29

### **3.3 Corporate Benefit vs. Public Good: A Financial Accounting**

A quantitative analysis of revenue flows reveals a stark contrast between the benefits accruing to the public and those captured by the multinational corporations operating offshore. The "principal beneficiary" clause of the Atlantic Accord, a politically powerful promise, becomes economically ambiguous when subjected to financial scrutiny. While the province receives substantial revenues, these are volatile and partially offset by reductions in federal transfers. In contrast, the corporate partners in the offshore projects generate massive, stable profits that translate into significant returns for their global shareholders.

For the 2023 fiscal or reporting year, a comparison is illustrative. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador received approximately $904.5 million in offshore royalties.31 Payments reported under the

*Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act* (ESTMA) show Suncor paid the province $192.8 million in royalties and ExxonMobil paid $184.8 million in taxes and fees.49 During the same period, the global financial performance of these parent companies was immense. ExxonMobil reported a net income of $36 billion and distributed $32.4 billion to shareholders.51 Chevron reported a net income of $21.4 billion and returned $26.3 billion to shareholders.52 Suncor reported net earnings of $8.3 billion and returned $5.0 billion to its shareholders.53

This juxtaposition suggests that while the province is a beneficiary, it is arguably not the *principal* one in terms of the scale and stability of financial returns. This economic reality, when set against a backdrop of high household debt and rising energy costs for the province's citizens 54, fuels the trust deficit. The gap between the political narrative of the Accord and the tangible economic outcomes creates a powerful sense that the public good is secondary to private corporate profit.

## **Part IV: Governance, Accountability, and Conflict**

The institutional frameworks designed to manage the offshore and ensure accountability are themselves fraught with contradictions. The primary regulator operates under a conflicted mandate, key transparency tools are blunted by legislative exemptions, and independent oversight bodies see their recommendations go unheeded. This governance deficit forces public discontent into extra-legal channels, transforming policy disputes into open conflict. The state's response to this conflict—treating dissent as a security threat—completes a cycle of eroding trust, where the very mechanisms of the state appear to prioritize industry protection over public accountability.

### **4.1 The Regulator's Tightrope: C-NLOPB's Conflicted Mandate**

The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), recently renamed the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Energy Regulator (C-NLOER), operates on a legislative tightrope, balancing two fundamentally conflicting roles.15 On one hand, the Board is mandated to promote resource development. Its activities, detailed in annual reports and official statistics, include issuing calls for bids for exploration parcels, granting exploration and production licenses, and approving development plans—all functions aimed at facilitating and expanding industrial activity in the offshore.11

On the other hand, the Accord Acts state that the Board's paramount responsibilities are the safety of offshore workers and the protection of the environment.59 Its regulatory functions include conducting safety audits, investigating environmental incidents, and enforcing compliance with operational standards.59 This dual mandate creates an inherent conflict of interest. The pressure to attract investment and maximize production for the economic benefit of both levels of government can run directly counter to the need for stringent, precautionary regulation. Every decision—from approving a development plan to responding to a spill—is made within this conflicted space, creating a persistent risk that the promotional imperative could compromise its paramount duties of safety and environmental stewardship.

### **4.2 Transparency and its Limits: The Role of ATIPPA and the Auditor General**

The primary mechanisms for public accountability—access to information legislation and independent audits—are significantly hampered in their ability to provide effective oversight of the offshore sector. The provincial *Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015* (ATIPPA) grants the public a right to access government records but contains broad exceptions that limit its effectiveness.63 Part II, Division 2 of the Act outlines numerous exceptions, including for Cabinet confidences and, most critically for the resource sector, information that could be "harmful to the business interests of a third party".64 This "commercial sensitivity" exemption can be used to shield the financial details of royalty agreements, government support packages, and project economics from public view, preventing a full accounting of the deals being struck in the public's name.65 A review of completed ATIPP requests reveals numerous inquiries related to oil and gas projects, but the extent of disclosure is often limited by these very exceptions.67

The Auditor General of Newfoundland and Labrador provides a more potent, independent check on government. However, recent reports demonstrate a pattern of significant findings followed by a lack of meaningful action. The June 2024 audit of the Oil and Gas Corporation (OilCo) uncovered serious issues, including the payment of excessive salaries to former Nalcor employees, failure to follow government procurement rules, and a persistent refusal to classify its positions as directed by government.69 Similarly, the 2024 audit of the province's public accounts reiterated a multi-year, outstanding recommendation that the government has failed to properly account for future offshore decommissioning costs—a liability that could significantly impact future royalty revenues.34 The persistent failure to implement these crucial recommendations signals a significant breakdown in the accountability loop, where independent oversight identifies serious problems but the government entities responsible fail to act.71

| Accountability and Oversight \- Key Auditor General Findings |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Report** | **Key Finding/Recommendation** | **Entity's Response** | **Status** |
| June 2024 OilCo Audit | **Recommendation:** OilCo should classify its positions on government scales, as directed by government. | **Rejection:** OilCo stated it would pursue a market-based compensation system, a proposal previously rejected by government. 69 | Outstanding \- OilCo refused to accept the recommendation. 69 |
| June 2024 OilCo Audit | **Finding:** Failure to solicit open bids for costly financial services contracts, contrary to government procurement policy. | **Acceptance:** OilCo stated it would work with the Public Procurement Agency to ensure compliance. 69 | Action Promised |
| 2024 Financial Statement Audit | **Recommendation:** Government should conclude its work to determine the impact of the carry-back of expected decommissioning costs on offshore royalties. | **No firm commitment:** Government indicated it was still working with the department to obtain information from operators. 34 | Outstanding \- Repeated recommendation from prior years. 34 |

### **4.3 From Protest to Policing: The Securitization of Resource Dissent**

When formal channels for accountability and redress fail, public discontent inevitably spills into the extra-legal realm of protest. The state's response to this dissent reveals the sharpest edge of the resource trust contradiction. Through federal bodies like Public Safety Canada, energy and transportation networks have been designated as "critical infrastructure," a classification that reframes opposition to resource projects not as legitimate democratic expression, but as a potential threat to national security and economic well-being.73

This "securitization" of dissent provides justification for heightened surveillance and policing. While the most prominent examples come from British Columbia, internal RCMP reports and watchdog investigations reveal a national strategy. Documents show RCMP national security units monitoring First Nations-led anti-pipeline activism for "potential threats," creating profiles of peaceful demonstrators, and sharing information with private corporations.75 This strategy is operationalized through specialized units like the RCMP's Community-Industry Response Group (C-IRG), a controversial group formed in 2017 specifically to police protests against resource extraction projects.78 The C-IRG has been accused of using militarized tactics, intimidation, and excessive force to enforce corporate injunctions against land defenders.81

This system demonstrates a stark inversion of accountability. Instead of public bodies and corporations being held accountable to the public for their management of shared resources, the members of the public who demand that accountability become the subjects of state surveillance and policing. The trust deficit is managed not through reform and reconciliation, but through security and enforcement, confirming the public's worst fears that the state is acting as a protector of industry rather than as a steward of the public interest. While the C-IRG has not been documented as operating in Newfoundland and Labrador, the existence of this national policing model for resource conflicts poses a critical question for the province's future as it navigates its own energy transition and the inevitable social conflicts that will arise.

## **Part V: Synthesis and Recommendations: Reconciling Resource, Trust, and Contradiction**

The governance of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore resources is defined by a series of nested contradictions. A legal framework of "simulated ownership" creates a dependency on political goodwill rather than clear title. An asymmetrical application of "trust" in law leaves the general public without the enforceable rights granted to Indigenous peoples, forcing them to rely on the volatile "Social License to Operate." An economic structure promises that the province will be the "principal beneficiary," yet delivers volatile revenues that are dwarfed by stable corporate profits and partially clawed back by federal programs. Finally, governance institutions responsible for oversight are compromised by conflicting mandates and a demonstrated lack of accountability, leading to a securitized response to public dissent. Together, these factors create a profound and measurable "trust deficit," where the state's pursuit of resource revenue systematically undermines the public confidence required for the long-term legitimacy of that pursuit. To address this core contradiction, a series of integrated reforms is necessary.

### **5.1 The Trust Deficit: A Synthesis of Legal, Economic, and Social Tensions**

The resource trust contradiction is a systemic issue, not a series of isolated problems. Its roots lie in the 1984 Supreme Court decision that denied the province's legal ownership of the offshore, forcing it into the *Atlantic Accord*—a political compromise that institutionalized ambiguity.10 This ambiguity is the source of the trust deficit. The province must trust the federal government not to exercise its paramountcy in a way that harms provincial interests, a trust that is tested with every change to the Equalization formula or federal environmental policy.3

The public, in turn, is asked to trust that the government and corporations are managing these resources in their best interest, but they lack the legal tools, such as an enforceable Public Trust Doctrine, to compel this outcome.22 Their only recourse is the withdrawal of the Social License to Operate, an act of defiance that the state then interprets as a security threat, not a symptom of broken trust.73 This cycle is fueled by economic data showing a disconnect between the vast wealth extracted from the offshore and the tangible, stable benefits accruing to the province and its people, especially when compared to corporate returns.31 The failure of accountability mechanisms, from the conflicted mandate of the C-NLOER to the unimplemented recommendations of the Auditor General, solidifies the public perception that the system is not designed for their benefit.60 This is the trust deficit in its entirety: a chasm between political promise and lived reality, sustained by a framework of contradiction.

### **5.2 Pathways to Reconciliation: Policy and Legal Recommendations**

Mitigating these contradictions and rebuilding public trust requires concrete, multi-faceted reforms aimed at increasing clarity, fairness, and accountability.

#### **Legal & Constitutional Reform:**

1. **Enact a Provincial Public Trust Act:** The provincial legislature should enact legislation that formally recognizes a version of the Public Trust Doctrine for all provincially-managed natural resources, including its role in the offshore. This would create a clear, legally-defined duty for the government to manage these resources for the long-term environmental and economic benefit of the public, providing citizens with a legal basis to challenge decisions that fail to meet this standard.  
2. **Clarify the Accord's Joint Management Principles:** The federal and provincial governments should initiate a formal review of the *Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* and Section 92A(3) of the *Constitution Act, 1867*. The goal would be to establish a clear framework or protocol for the exercise of federal paramountcy, ensuring that it is used only in cases of clear national interest and does not unilaterally undermine the principle of joint management and the province's role as principal beneficiary.

#### **Economic & Fiscal Reform:**

1. **Reform the Equalization Formula:** The Government of Canada should lead a federal-provincial review of the Equalization formula's treatment of non-renewable resource revenues. The objective should be to eliminate the "clawback" effect that penalizes provinces for resource development, thereby aligning the program with the principle of encouraging economic self-sufficiency.47  
2. **Mandate Decommissioning Cost Accounting:** The C-NLOER, through regulation, should require that all future development applications and existing royalty agreements include a transparent, publicly disclosed formula for accounting for estimated decommissioning costs. This would directly address the Auditor General's long-standing recommendation and provide a more accurate picture of net public revenue.34  
3. **Strengthen the Provincial Sovereign Wealth Fund:** The province should reform the management of its sovereign wealth fund to better insulate public services from resource revenue volatility. Drawing on the Norwegian model, this would involve stricter rules for deposits and withdrawals, ensuring that a larger portion of non-renewable resource revenue is saved and invested for future generations, as analyzed in research from Memorial University.86

#### **Governance & Accountability Reform:**

1. **Restructure the Offshore Regulator:** The C-NLOER should be structurally reformed to separate its dual functions. A new, independent body should be created with the sole mandate of promoting and managing resource tenure (e.g., calls for bids), while the C-NLOER retains a focused mandate on the regulation of safety, environmental protection, and conservation. This would eliminate the inherent conflict of interest.  
2. **Amend ATIPPA for Greater Transparency:** The provincial *Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act* should be amended to narrow the scope of the "harm to business interests" exemption. While protecting legitimate trade secrets, the amendment should clarify that the core financial terms of resource development agreements with public bodies are matters of public interest and must be disclosed after an agreement is finalized.  
3. **Empower the Auditor General's Recommendations:** The House of Assembly should establish a formal, public mechanism, such as a dedicated sub-committee of the Public Accounts Committee, with the explicit mandate to track the implementation of all Auditor General recommendations and require public bodies, including OilCo, to provide public explanations for any failures to act.87  
4. **De-securitize Resource Dissent:** The federal government should initiate a national inquiry into the policing of resource-related protests, with a specific focus on the mandate and conduct of specialized units like the C-IRG. The goal should be to develop a national policing standard for such protests that prioritizes de-escalation and the protection of Charter rights of expression and assembly, moving away from a framework of "critical infrastructure" protection that frames dissent as a security threat.75
