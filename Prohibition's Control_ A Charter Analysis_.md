## **The Prohibitive State: From Drug Laws to a Logic of Control**

The legal framework governing controlled substances in Canada is more than a set of statutes; it represents a foundational logic of social control that has permeated and shaped multiple facets of Canadian society. This section establishes the report's central thesis: that Canadian drug prohibition, architected through the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA), is not a benign public health policy but a governing paradigm rooted in a history of racial and social control. This paradigm has, in turn, spawned a self-perpetuating "crisis economy" that generates immense financial and human costs, all while failing to achieve its stated objectives. The logic of prohibition serves as the root pattern for a wider system of intervention and management that extends into policing, housing, family law, and mental health, with devastating consequences for fundamental human rights.

### **The Architecture of Prohibition: The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA)**

The legal cornerstone of Canada's drug policy is the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA), a federal statute that establishes a comprehensive regime of prohibition for a wide range of substances classified into schedules.1 The Act makes it a criminal offence to possess, traffic, import, export, or produce any substance listed in its schedules except as authorized under regulations.2 The severity of the penalties prescribed by the CDSA underscores its punitive, rather than health-focused, orientation. For instance, the production of a substance included in Schedule I or II, which includes substances like opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine, is an indictable offence liable to imprisonment for life.2 The production of substances in Schedule III, such as psilocybin, carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.2

The CDSA's definition of "production" is exceptionally broad, encompassing not only manufacturing and synthesis but also "cultivating, propagating or harvesting the substance or any living thing from which the substance may be extracted or otherwise obtained".3 This expansive definition ensures that a vast range of activities, from large-scale manufacturing to small-scale cultivation for personal or therapeutic use, fall under the same criminal prohibition, subject to severe sanction. This legal architecture creates the primary mechanism of control: the ever-present threat of criminal charges and imprisonment, which directly engages the liberty interests of every person in Canada who uses a controlled substance without state authorization.5

The rigidity of this framework is exemplified by the legal status of psychedelics. Despite a burgeoning body of scientific evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of substances like psilocybin for treating conditions such as depression, PTSD, and addiction 6, it remains a Schedule III substance under the CDSA.4 Access for therapeutic purposes is extraordinarily limited, available only through narrow exemptions like Health Canada's Special Access Program (SAP) or clinical trials.4 Even as courts have begun to challenge Health Canada's restrictive approach, ruling its refusal to grant exemptions for therapist training as "unreasonable" 8, the underlying prohibitive structure of the CDSA remains intact. This demonstrates how the Act functions not as a flexible tool for public health management but as a rigid instrument of control, prioritizing a blanket ban over evidence-based therapeutic access.

### **The Racist and Colonial Foundations of Canadian Drug Policy**

To understand the logic of the current system, one must excavate its historical foundations. Canadian drug prohibition was not born from a concern for public health but from racist and colonial imperatives aimed at controlling racialized populations.9 The very first federal anti-drug legislation, the

*Opium Act* of 1908, was a direct consequence of an anti-Asian race riot in Vancouver in 1907\.10 The law was not designed to protect people from the harms of opium but to specifically target and punish Chinese Canadian communities, with whom opium smoking was associated, as a means of furthering a white nationalist agenda.9

This pattern of using substance laws as a proxy for racial and social control is a defining feature of Canadian history. An 1884 amendment to *The Indian Act* prohibited the sale of alcohol to Indigenous peoples, not for their welfare, but as a tool of colonial governance, policing, and forced assimilation.9 Throughout the early 20th century, moral panics stoked by media and reformers linked drug use to Chinese immigrants, leading to harsher enforcement and new crackdowns.10 This historical context is crucial: it reveals that the disproportionate impact of drug laws on racialized communities today is not an unforeseen consequence but the fulfillment of the policy's original intent.

This racist logic was modernized and amplified during the "war on drugs" of the 1980s. Following the lead of the United States, Canada's "National Drug Strategy," rolled out under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, initiated a period of increased street surveillance and the militarization of police forces.9 The rhetoric of this era linked drugs like crack and heroin to Black populations, weaponizing public fear to justify punitive policies.9 This trend of prioritizing enforcement over health continued for decades. By 2008, under the Stephen Harper government, over three-quarters of the National Drug Strategy's funding was allocated to policing, at the direct expense of addiction treatment and mental health supports.9 These policies, implemented without an evidence base, have entrenched a system of state violence and mass incarceration that disproportionately harms Indigenous and Black Canadians, who are overrepresented in federal prisons by 600% and 300%, respectively.9 The system's design, rooted in a history of racism, ensures its discriminatory function.

### **The 'Crisis Economy': Quantifying the Costs of a Failed System**

The enduring logic of prohibition has created what can be termed a "crisis economy"—a self-perpetuating system that generates enormous financial and social costs, which in turn justify its own existence and expansion. This economy is fueled by the very harms the policy creates.

The direct financial costs are staggering. In 2020, substance use cost the Canadian economy an estimated $49.1 billion.11 A significant portion of this, $10 billion, was dedicated to the criminal justice system, covering the costs of policing, courts, and corrections for substance-related offences.11 This amounts to $262 for every person in Canada spent on criminalizing a health issue. The data reveals that these costs are driven by the legal framework itself. Alcohol, a legal and regulated substance, accounted for $4 billion in criminal justice costs, primarily from violent crime, while costs for illegal substances like opioids and cocaine were primarily related to non-violent crime.12 This suggests that the act of prohibition and the creation of an illegal market are major drivers of justice system involvement. The legalization of cannabis provides a clear counter-example: criminal justice costs attributable to cannabis decreased by over 21% between 2007 and 2020, with a steep 13.5% drop in the two years following legalization, due to fewer charges for possession.12

Beyond direct costs, the crisis economy imposes a massive burden of $22.4 billion in lost productivity, largely due to premature death and disability.11 Opioid use alone cost $7.1 billion in 2020, with nearly 75% of that figure attributable to lost productivity from people dying in their prime.11 This points to the most devastating output of the prohibition-fueled crisis economy: the toxic, unpredictable illegal drug supply. The Government of Canada itself identifies this toxic supply as a primary factor in the overdose crisis, which has claimed over 52,544 lives since 2016 and resulted in tens of thousands of hospitalizations.13

This dynamic reveals a perverse logic. The state maintains a prohibitionist legal framework (the CDSA) that directly creates a deadly illegal market. The catastrophic death toll from this market is then framed as a "crisis" that requires more state intervention. This intervention, however, often takes the form of expanded surveillance (such as wastewater drug testing and enhanced laboratory analysis) and enforcement, further entrenching the roles of the very institutions that manage the crisis.13 The system is sustained by the problems it creates. Billions are spent on policing a crisis that would not exist in its current form without the policy of prohibition. This creates a powerful institutional inertia, as dismantling the system of prohibition would threaten the budgets, mandates, and influence of the police, justice, and corrections sectors that have grown to manage its predictable and fatal consequences. This crisis economy is not a bug in the system; it is the engine that keeps it running.

## **The Web of Control: Mapping the Interlocking Systems**

The foundational logic of drug prohibition—the identification, management, and punishment of a designated "deviant" population—does not remain confined to the realm of criminal law. It metastasizes, providing the blueprint for a wider, interlocking system of social control that extends into the domains of housing, policing, child welfare, and mental health. This web of control operates through what critical theorists call "interlocking systems of oppression," where discrimination based on substance use intersects with and compounds discrimination based on poverty, race, and health status.14 Each system reinforces the others, creating a seamless pipeline that channels marginalized individuals from one locus of state control to the next, stripping them of their rights and autonomy at every stage. This section maps the key nodes in this web, demonstrating how they are animated by the same core logic and enabled by shared technologies and policies of surveillance and social sorting.

### **The Criminalization of Poverty, Homelessness, and Survival**

The prohibitionist logic finds a potent expression in the criminalization of poverty and homelessness. Because substance use is often intertwined with economic marginalization and housing instability, laws and policies that target the poor effectively become extensions of the drug war. While appearing neutral on their face, these regulations disproportionately punish the very existence and survival strategies of people experiencing homelessness.16

A prime example is Ontario's *Safe Streets Act*, which imposes fines for activities like "aggressive" panhandling or soliciting from drivers.18 Research shows that these laws are used to issue thousands of tickets to people experiencing homelessness—tickets it is known they cannot pay.20 In Toronto, approximately 16,000 such tickets are issued annually, consuming $2 million in policing resources, yet over 99% go unpaid.20 The purpose of these tickets is not revenue generation; it is to create a legal pretext for further engagement with the criminal justice system. Unpaid fines accumulate, leading to more serious charges and potentially imprisonment.18 This creates a vicious cycle: a person is penalized for the public performance of poverty, acquires a criminal record for unpaid fines, and that record then becomes a formidable barrier to securing the very housing and employment needed to exit poverty.18

This phenomenon is not limited to provincial statutes. Municipal bylaws that regulate behaviour in public spaces—prohibiting sleeping in parks, for instance—function to criminalize the necessary life-sustaining activities of those with no private space to retreat to.17 During the COVID-19 pandemic, people were ticketed for not being at home when they had no home to go to.18 This system of control, as the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing noted, is often framed as a matter of public safety but is in reality about "beautifying" areas and removing the visible presence of poverty.17 It is a direct application of the prohibitionist logic: identify an undesirable population and use legal instruments to control, punish, and displace them. This process demonstrates the interlocking nature of oppression, where class-based discrimination is operationalized through the justice system, perpetuating the marginalization it claims to address.14

### **The Surveillance Apparatus: From Social Sorting to Predictive Policing**

The technological infrastructure of this web of control is a rapidly expanding surveillance apparatus that operationalizes the prohibitionist logic of identifying, tracking, and managing "at-risk" populations. These technologies are not neutral tools; they are infused with the historical biases of the systems they are designed to serve, creating a high-tech engine for discrimination and social control.

At the forefront is the rise of algorithmic policing. Police services across Canada are adopting predictive policing systems, such as the Vancouver Police Department's GeoDASH, which aims to forecast property crime hotspots, and a host of algorithmic surveillance tools, including Automated Licence Plate Readers (ALPRs) and facial recognition software like the controversial Clearview AI.23 The fundamental flaw in these systems is that they are trained on historical police data.24 Given that Canadian drug law enforcement has racist origins and has always disproportionately targeted Indigenous and Black communities 9, the data fed into these algorithms is inherently biased. The result is a discriminatory feedback loop: the algorithm "predicts" crime will occur in the same racialized, over-policed neighbourhoods, justifying an even greater police presence and leading to more arrests, which then "proves" the algorithm was correct.24 This process has been termed "math-washing," where deep-seated systemic racism is laundered through the supposedly objective and scientific language of data and algorithms, crystallizing prejudice into policy.23

This surveillance extends beyond predictive crime-fighting into a broader project of "social sorting".27 The key mechanism for this is the expanding network of information-sharing agreements (ISAs) and collaborative bodies that link law enforcement with social services, health authorities, and school boards.28 The "Hub model," known in Ontario as "Situation Tables," exemplifies this approach.31 These are multi-agency meetings where police, social workers, school officials, and healthcare providers share highly sensitive information about individuals deemed to be at "acutely elevated risk" of harm or criminal activity.31 The information is logged in provincial "Risk-driven Tracking Databases" (RTDs), which track over 100 "risk factors," including substance use, mental health status, being a victim of assault, or living in a "negative neighborhood".31

This process often occurs without the individual's knowledge or consent, creating a system of pre-emptive, non-consensual surveillance and intervention.31 It is the epitome of social sorting: individuals are profiled, categorized, and managed based on a composite risk score generated from fragmented data points collected across multiple domains of their lives. The logic is explicitly pre-emptive, allowing police to intervene in situations where they previously had no authority.31 This apparatus, enabled by data-sharing policies and surveillance technology, operationalizes the core principle of the prohibitionist mindset: that certain populations are inherently risky and must be managed and controlled before they cause problems.

### **The Family as a Site of Intervention: The Child Welfare-to-Prison Pipeline**

The child welfare system, governed by legislation like Ontario's *Child, Youth and Family Services Act* (CYFSA), operates as another critical node in the web of control. It extends the state's reach directly into the family, disproportionately targeting Indigenous and Black communities and frequently using parental substance use as a justification for intervention and separation.

The findings of the Ontario Human Rights Commission's (OHRC) landmark report, "Interrupted Childhoods," are damning and unequivocal.33 The report confirmed that Indigenous and Black children are vastly over-represented in the child welfare system. In Ontario, Indigenous children are admitted into care at a rate 2.6 times higher than their proportion in the child population, while Black children are admitted at a rate 2.2 times higher.33 These are not statistical anomalies; they are the predictable outcomes of a system deeply intertwined with Canada's history of colonialism and anti-Black racism.35

The report connects this over-representation directly to the prohibitionist logic. The primary reason cited for the removal of Indigenous children is "neglect," a term often used as a proxy for the symptoms of intergenerational trauma and poverty—such as substance use and inadequate housing—that are the direct legacy of colonial policies like the residential school system.36 Similarly, the over-monitoring of Black families is attributed to racist stereotypes and the economic vulnerability caused by systemic discrimination.33 The system is structured to punish the very conditions that state policies have created.

The bias is evident in how substance use is handled. While rates of substance use are comparable across racial groups, and in some cases higher among white populations, racialized communities bear a significantly higher burden of criminalization and intervention.39 They are more likely to be reported to authorities and less likely to be offered culturally appropriate, supportive services.39 Risk assessment tools used by Children's Aid Societies (CASs) have been criticized for reflecting white, middle-class norms and for being applied with conscious or unconscious bias by caseworkers.33 This systemic funneling of children from marginalized communities into state care creates what is known as the "child-welfare-to-prison pipeline".33 Youth who age out of the care system face higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, and involvement with the criminal justice system, perpetuating a cycle of state control across generations.38 State intervention in the family, justified by the same logic of risk and control that underpins drug prohibition, becomes a primary pathway to future criminalization.

### **Coercion as Care: The Expansion of Involuntary Treatment**

The latest and perhaps most insidious extension of the prohibitionist logic is the growing political movement for compulsory addiction treatment. Proposals, such as those advanced in Alberta, seek to amend mental health legislation to allow police, healthcare professionals, or even family members to petition for an "addiction treatment order" that would force an individual into involuntary treatment.41 This approach represents the ultimate fusion of the system's various arms, deploying the coercive power of the state under the benevolent guise of "care."

This model is a direct application of the logic of control. It is predicated on a judgment that an individual who uses substances is incapable of making their own decisions and must have their liberty removed for their own good. The Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) has strongly condemned this approach, presenting evidence that it is both ineffective and profoundly harmful.41 Evidence from jurisdictions with such policies shows that compulsory treatment does not improve long-term health outcomes or prevent overdose deaths. In fact, it can increase the risk of a fatal overdose upon release, as an individual's tolerance to drugs is lowered during forced abstinence.41

Furthermore, this coercive model violates fundamental human rights, deepens the stigma against people who use substances, and actively deters them from seeking voluntary help for fear of being apprehended.41 The scope of the proposed legislation in Alberta is particularly alarming, as it could apply to anyone whose substance use is deemed to make them a "danger to themselves or others," a vague standard that opens the door to sweeping up individuals who do not have a substance use disorder.41 This represents an expansion of criminalization under a different name, a form of civil incarceration that disproportionately targets the same structurally disadvantaged and racialized populations that are the focus of the rest of the control system.41 It is the logical endpoint of a system that sees coercion, rather than support, as the primary solution to a health and social issue.

### **The Interlocking System of Control: A Synthesis**

The evidence demonstrates a clear and repeating pattern across multiple domains of social policy. The root logic of drug prohibition—identifying a "problem" population, subjecting it to surveillance, and managing it through coercion and control—is replicated in policies governing homelessness, policing, child welfare, and mental health. These are not separate, isolated systems but interconnected nodes in a comprehensive web of control. Their unifying principle is a process of social sorting based on perceived risk, where substance use, poverty, and racial identity are key markers that trigger state intervention. This process is increasingly formalized and automated through surveillance technologies and data-sharing agreements, creating a documented pipeline that moves individuals between systems, eroding their rights at each step. The disproportionate and devastating impact on Indigenous and Black communities is not a flaw in this system; it is the system functioning exactly as it was designed, perpetuating the historical project of racial and social control under new, modern guises.

| Domain | Core Logic | Key Mechanisms | Enabling Technology/Policy | Primary Targeted Population |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Drug Law (Root Pattern)** | Prohibition & Control | Criminalization of possession/production, severe penalties | *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA) 2 | Racialized & impoverished communities |
| **Policing** | Pre-emptive Surveillance & Management | Criminalization of poverty/homelessness, racial profiling, social sorting | Algorithmic Policing, Facial Recognition, Risk-driven Tracking Databases (RTDs) 24 | Street-involved individuals, racialized youth |
| **Family Law** | Risk Assessment & Family Separation | Over-reporting, biased risk tools, removal for "neglect" | *Child, Youth and Family Services Act* (CYFSA), Information Sharing Agreements 32 | Indigenous & Black families |
| **Housing** | Exclusion & Displacement | Ticketing for survival activities, no-trespass orders, encampment clearing | *Safe Streets Acts*, municipal bylaws 17 | Individuals experiencing homelessness |
| **Mental Health** | Coercive Care | Involuntary treatment orders based on "danger" | Proposed amendments to *Mental Health Acts* 41 | People who use substances, individuals in crisis |

## **The Constitutional Injury: A Systematic Violation of Section 7**

The interlocking system of social control, founded on the logic of drug prohibition, is not merely a matter of poor or harmful policy. It constitutes a profound and systematic violation of the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*. Specifically, the system as a whole infringes upon the rights to life, liberty, and security of the person, as protected by Section 7 of the *Charter*. Crucially, this deprivation of rights is not carried out "in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice." Instead, the system operates in a manner that is arbitrary, overbroad, and grossly disproportionate, rendering it unconstitutional. This section will lay out the legal argument for this constitutional injury, demonstrating how the cumulative effects of the control apparatus amount to an indefensible breach of Canada's supreme law.

### **The Scope of Section 7: Life, Liberty, and Security of the Person**

Section 7 of the *Charter* states: "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice".5 A legal challenge under Section 7 requires a two-step analysis. First, the claimant must demonstrate that a law or state action causes a deprivation of one or more of the three protected interests: life, liberty, or security of the person. Second, if a deprivation is established, the burden shifts to the state to show that the deprivation has been carried out in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.5

The Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted these protected interests broadly. The right to life is engaged not only by actions that directly impose death but also by those that create an increased risk of death.5 The right to liberty extends beyond mere freedom from physical restraint, such as imprisonment, to encompass the autonomy to make "fundamental personal choices" of profound importance to the individual.42 Finally, the right to security of the person protects against state interference with bodily integrity and health, as well as safeguarding an individual's "psychological integrity" from serious, state-inflicted mental distress or trauma.43 It is against this robust constitutional standard that the system of control must be measured.

### **Deprivation of the Right to Life**

The most egregious constitutional injury inflicted by the system of prohibition is its violation of the right to life. The state, through its continued enforcement of the CDSA, actively creates and sustains a toxic, unregulated illegal drug supply. This is not a speculative or distant harm; it is the direct and foreseeable cause of the overdose crisis that has killed more than 52,544 people in Canada since 2016\.13 The federal government itself acknowledges that a "highly toxic and unpredictable illegal drug supply" is a primary factor contributing to these deaths.13

This state action squarely engages the right to life as defined by the Supreme Court. In *Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)*, the Court affirmed that the right to life is implicated where state action imposes "an increased risk of death".5 The prohibitionist regime does precisely that. By making it impossible to legally obtain substances of known purity and dosage, the state forces hundreds of thousands of Canadians to play a daily game of Russian roulette, consuming substances that are frequently and secretly contaminated with lethal analogues like fentanyl.13

This deprivation is compounded by the system's active obstruction of life-saving health services. The landmark case of *Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society* (the *Insite* case) established that denying access to a supervised consumption site—a proven harm reduction measure—could deprive individuals of their right to life by preventing them from receiving emergency medical care in the event of an overdose.44 The logic of

*Insite* applies with even greater force to the system as a whole. The criminalization, stigma, and fear generated by the entire control apparatus deter people from accessing the very services that could save their lives, constituting a systemic, state-imposed increase in the risk of death.

### **Deprivation of the Right to Liberty**

The system of control infringes upon the Section 7 right to liberty in both its physical and autonomy-related dimensions. The most direct deprivation is the constant threat of imprisonment. The CDSA prescribes severe penalties, including life sentences, for production and trafficking offences.2 Moreover, the criminalization of poverty and homelessness means that individuals can be incarcerated for unpaid fines related to survival activities.18 This ever-present threat of physical restraint is a clear and ongoing deprivation of liberty.

More profoundly, the system violates the liberty interest in making "fundamental personal choices." The Supreme Court has recognized that this aspect of liberty protects a sphere of personal autonomy where individuals can make decisions of core importance to their identity and well-being.42 The choice of what to introduce into one's own body and how to manage one's own health falls squarely within this protected sphere. The case of

*R. v. Parker* is instructive. There, the Ontario Court of Appeal found that forcing an individual to choose between their health (using medical cannabis) and their liberty (avoiding imprisonment) was a violation of Section 7\.46

The current system of prohibition imposes this unconstitutional choice on a massive scale. It forces individuals to choose between their health—whether it be managing chronic pain, treating a mental health condition, or simply maintaining their well-being—and their freedom. The blanket prohibition denies individuals the autonomy to make informed decisions about their own bodies and consciousness, a choice that is fundamental to human dignity and self-determination. This is a profound deprivation of liberty that goes far beyond the walls of a prison.

### **Deprivation of the Right to Security of the Person**

The right to security of the person is violated by the system of control in a compounding and multifaceted manner, assaulting both the physical and psychological well-being of individuals.

First, the system directly undermines physical health and bodily integrity. As established, it forces people to consume substances from a toxic, unregulated market, exposing them to poisoning, overdose, and infectious diseases.13 It also creates significant barriers to accessing essential healthcare. The

*Insite* decision was grounded in the finding that denying access to supervised injection services threatened the security of the person by exposing individuals to increased risks of death and disease.45 This principle extends to the denial of other harm reduction services and the obstruction of access to potentially life-changing therapeutic substances, such as psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression or PTSD.6 Forcing individuals to endure debilitating conditions because the only effective treatment is prohibited is a direct state interference with health and security of the person.

Second, the system inflicts immense and continuous psychological trauma, violating the "psychological integrity" aspect of the security right.43 The constant fear of arrest, eviction, the seizure of one's children, or being forced into involuntary treatment creates a state of chronic, state-imposed stress. The pervasive stigma, fueled by the language of criminality and immorality, leads to social isolation and dehumanization.47 The experience of being under constant surveillance, whether by police patrols in one's neighbourhood or by algorithmic systems tracking one's "risk factors," is a profound intrusion into the mental state of an individual.24 This sustained psychological assault, directly attributable to the actions and policies of the state, constitutes a severe and ongoing deprivation of the right to security of the person.

### **Breach of the Principles of Fundamental Justice**

The deprivations of life, liberty, and security of the person detailed above are not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The entire system of control is unconstitutional because it is arbitrary, overbroad, and grossly disproportionate.

**Arbitrariness:** A law or state action is arbitrary if it bears no rational connection to its stated objective.43 The stated objective of Canada's drug laws is the protection of public health and safety.45 However, the prohibitionist system does the opposite: it fuels a toxic drug supply that causes mass death, spreads disease, and destabilizes communities.13 The system is therefore arbitrary because its effects are fundamentally disconnected from, and indeed contrary to, its purpose. The Supreme Court's reasoning in

*Insite* is directly applicable here. The Court found the Minister's decision to deny an exemption was arbitrary because it undermined the CDSA's own goals of promoting health and safety.45 By the same logic, the entire system of prohibition, which consistently prioritizes punishment over health and produces catastrophic health outcomes, is arbitrary.

**Overbreadth:** A law is overbroad if it is wider than necessary to achieve its objective, infringing rights in the process.43 The system of prohibition is a textbook example of overbreadth. To achieve the goal of discouraging problematic substance use, it employs a blanket criminal ban that sweeps in millions of Canadians who use substances without issue.47 It criminalizes simple possession, a state of being, rather than specific harmful acts. It extends its reach to penalize survival behaviours like panhandling 18, to surveil entire communities through biased algorithms 24, and to intervene in families based on culturally biased risk assessments.36 A rational, health-focused approach would be narrowly tailored to address substance use disorders and associated harms. The current system, in its attempt to eradicate all unapproved substance use, is vastly and unnecessarily overbroad.

**Gross Disproportionality:** A law is grossly disproportionate when its effects on life, liberty, and security are so severe that they are "out of sync" with any legitimate state objective.43 This principle requires a balancing of the negative impacts of the law against its societal benefits. For the system of prohibition, the scales are not even close. On one side, we have the devastating effects: tens of thousands of preventable deaths 13; billions of dollars in policing and incarceration costs 12; the creation of a violent illegal market; the entrenchment of systemic racism and the mass incarceration of Indigenous and Black people 9; the destruction of families through the child welfare system 33; and the infliction of widespread psychological trauma. On the other side, the "benefit" is the pursuit of a moralistic and symbolic goal of a "drug-free" society, a goal that has never been achieved and has come at an unconscionable human cost. The severe and lethal effects of the system are grossly disproportionate to its objective, rendering the ongoing deprivation of Section 7 rights fundamentally unjust.

### **Section 7 Charter Analysis of the System of Control: A Synthesis**

The constitutional case against the system of control is comprehensive and damning. It systematically deprives individuals of their most basic rights in a manner that offends the core principles of Canadian justice. A piecemeal legal strategy, challenging one regulation or one policy at a time, is insufficient to address the scale of the injury. The harm arises from the cumulative and interlocking nature of the system as a whole. Therefore, a successful constitutional challenge must frame the violation as arising from the entire legislative and policy scheme, arguing that the CDSA, when viewed in the context of its enforcement through surveillance, child welfare policies, bylaws, and coercive treatment regimes, creates an unconstitutional system that must be struck down.

| Protected Right | Nature of the Deprivation by the System | Key Evidence / Precedent |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Life** | Imposes an increased risk of death from a toxic, unregulated drug supply and denies access to life-saving harm reduction services. | National overdose death statistics 13; CPHA critique of ineffective and dangerous involuntary treatment 41; | *Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society*.45 |
| **Liberty** | Imposes the threat of imprisonment and infringes on the fundamental personal choice to manage one's own health and consciousness. | CDSA penalties for possession and production 2; criminalization of homelessness and survival activities 18; | *R. v. Parker*.46 |
| **Security of the Person** | Inflicts direct physical harm through the toxic drug supply and causes severe, state-imposed psychological trauma through stigma, surveillance, and the constant threat of family separation or forced treatment. | Overdose crisis data 13; evidence of pervasive surveillance systems (RTDs, algorithmic policing) 24; OHRC "Interrupted Childhoods" report 33; | *Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society*.45 |

## **A Constitutionally-Grounded Path Forward: Charter Supremacy, Harm Reduction, and Cognitive Liberty**

Diagnosing the unconstitutionality of the prohibitionist system of control is the necessary first step; dismantling it requires a clear, principled, and legally sound path forward. Such a path cannot be found in minor policy tweaks or incremental adjustments. It must be grounded in the supreme law of Canada—the *Charter*—and animated by a fundamental shift in philosophy from control to care. This section outlines a three-pronged framework for reform, arguing that the principles of *Charter* supremacy, harm reduction, and cognitive liberty, taken together, provide a robust and constitutionally mandated foundation for ending the crisis of prohibition and building a new paradigm based on human rights, evidence, and autonomy.

### **Invoking Charter Supremacy: The Constitution as the Ultimate Authority**

The primary legal instrument for dismantling the system of control is the principle of *Charter* supremacy. Section 52(1) of the *Constitution Act, 1982* unequivocally states that "the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect".49 This clause is not merely symbolic; it is a binding directive to courts to invalidate laws and government actions that violate

*Charter* rights.51

This principle provides a direct answer to one of the most common political arguments against fundamental drug law reform: that Canada is bound by international drug control treaties, such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. This argument is constitutionally unsound. In the Canadian legal order, international treaties do not automatically become part of domestic law; they must be implemented through legislation passed by Parliament or a legislature.51 Any such implementing legislation is, like all other laws, subject to

*Charter* scrutiny. If a law passed to comply with an international treaty violates a *Charter* right—such as the Section 7 right to life—the *Charter* prevails.51 The Constitution is supreme.

The Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the *Charter*, particularly in *R. v. Hape*, reinforces this principle.54 In that case, the Court grappled with whether the

*Charter* applied to Canadian police officers operating abroad. The majority concluded that while Canadian law must respect the sovereignty of other nations, this does not create a "Charter-free zone" for Canadian officials.54 The Court's framework prioritizes Canadian constitutional norms and the protection of fair trial rights under Section 7, even in the context of international cooperation.55 By analogy, the government cannot use its international policy commitments as a shield to justify domestic laws that result in the mass death of its own citizens. The

*Charter's* fundamental command to protect the right to life under Section 7 must take precedence over international conventions that demand a prohibitionist approach proven to be lethal. *Charter* supremacy mandates a "Canada-first" approach to fundamental rights, empowering courts to strike down the CDSA and its related control mechanisms, irrespective of international treaty obligations.

### **Harm Reduction as a Constitutional Imperative**

If the current system is unconstitutional because it violates the right to life, then the remedy must be a system that protects life. This reframes harm reduction not as a discretionary policy choice but as a constitutional imperative flowing directly from the state's duties under Section 7\. Harm reduction is a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that seeks to minimize the negative health, social, and legal impacts associated with drug use, without necessarily requiring abstinence. The evidence for its effectiveness is overwhelming.

The international case study of Portugal provides a powerful roadmap. In 2001, Portugal decriminalized the personal possession of all drugs and simultaneously made massive investments in a public health response, including treatment, harm reduction services, and social supports.58 The results were transformative. Overdose deaths plummeted by over 90%, from 80 deaths per million in 2001 to just 6 per million by 2021\.59 New HIV infections among people who inject drugs fell dramatically, and the burden on the criminal justice system eased, with the proportion of prisoners sentenced for drug offences falling from over 40% to below 16%.60 Crucially, these positive public health outcomes were not accompanied by a significant increase in overall drug use; in fact, use among young people declined.59 Portugal's success demonstrates that a health-centered, non-prohibitionist approach is vastly superior at achieving the state's legitimate objective of protecting public health and safety.

In Canada, there is a growing consensus among experts that the current path is a failure. The federal government's own Expert Task Force on Substance Use has unequivocally recommended an end to criminal penalties for simple possession, the expungement of criminal records, and a massive investment in a full spectrum of supports, including pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to the illegal supply (i.e., safe supply).47 Limited experiments, like British Columbia's three-year decriminalization pilot, are a step in the right direction but have been criticized for their limitations, such as thresholds that are too low and new restrictions on public consumption that undermine the policy's public health goals.1

The constitutional argument crystallizes here: if the state has a positive obligation under Section 7 to protect the lives of its citizens, and if the evidence conclusively shows that the prohibitionist model is lethal while a comprehensive harm reduction model saves lives, then the state is constitutionally compelled to adopt the life-saving approach. Continuing with a policy known to cause mass death when a proven, effective alternative exists is a clear and ongoing violation of the right to life. The implementation of a comprehensive harm reduction framework—including the full decriminalization of possession, the provision of a safe, regulated supply of substances, and the expansion of accessible, voluntary health and social services—is not just good policy; it is a constitutional necessity.

### **The Right to Cognitive Liberty: A New Principle of Fundamental Justice**

The final and most transformative element of a constitutionally grounded path forward involves recognizing "cognitive liberty" as a fundamental principle of justice. This moves the argument beyond the defensive posture of harm reduction—which focuses on mitigating the negative consequences of a failed policy—to a positive assertion of a fundamental human right: the right to self-determination over one's own mind and mental experiences.63 Cognitive liberty encompasses both the right to use or refrain from using technologies and substances that alter consciousness, and the right to be free from coercive or non-consensual interference with one's own thought processes.66

This right is not created out of thin air; it is an evolution of existing *Charter* protections, updated for the challenges of the 21st century. It finds its roots in two key sections of the *Charter*.

First, Section 2(b) guarantees "freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression".69 The Supreme Court has affirmed that the purpose of this freedom is to promote the search for truth, enable participation in democracy, and allow for "individual self-fulfillment through expression".69 In

*R. v. Sharpe*, the Court recognized that the possession of expressive material is protected because it is "integrally related to the development of thought".71 The argument for cognitive liberty extends this logic: the freedom to

*have* a thought is rendered meaningless without the freedom of the underlying thought *process*. The brain is the biological substrate of thought. State actions that prohibit individuals from altering their own brain chemistry and consciousness are a direct and profound interference with the very faculty of thought that Section 2(b) is meant to protect.

Second, cognitive liberty is deeply embedded within the Section 7 rights to liberty and security of the person. As established, the right to liberty protects the autonomy to make "fundamental personal choices" 43, while security of the person protects psychological integrity.43 The choice to explore, modify, or heal one's own consciousness is arguably one of the most intimate and fundamental personal decisions an individual can make. Prohibiting access to substances, particularly those with demonstrated therapeutic potential like psilocybin and other psychedelics 6, is a direct affront to this autonomy. It denies individuals the right to make choices about their own mental and spiritual well-being, interfering with their liberty and security of the person.

By establishing cognitive liberty as a principle of fundamental justice, the legal argument against prohibition is placed on its strongest possible footing. It asserts that the state cannot deprive individuals of their Section 7 rights by criminalizing substances, because a blanket prohibition is fundamentally incompatible with the right to mental self-determination. This reframes the entire debate. The issue is no longer merely about whether the state's policy is causing too much harm; it is about whether the state has any right to exercise this form of control over the inner lives of its citizens in the first place. This principle provides the ultimate legal and philosophical foundation for dismantling the entire edifice of prohibition and replacing it with a regulatory framework based on autonomy, safety, evidence, and respect for the fundamental freedom to think.

### **Conclusion: Dismantling the Pattern of Control**

The thesis of this report has been demonstrated: Canadian drug prohibition is the root pattern for a sprawling, interlocking system of social control that systematically violates the Section 7 *Charter* rights to life, liberty, and security of the person. This system, born from a racist and colonial history, perpetuates a self-sustaining crisis economy that channels billions into enforcement and surveillance while producing catastrophic human costs. Its logic of control has metastasized into policing, child welfare, housing, and mental health, creating a seamless web that ensnares the most marginalized members of society, particularly Indigenous and Black communities.

The deprivations inflicted by this system are not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice; they are arbitrary, overbroad, and grossly disproportionate. The path forward, therefore, must be one of fundamental constitutional realignment. This requires invoking the supremacy of the *Charter* to override any conflicting laws or international obligations that perpetuate this harm. It demands that harm reduction be recognized not as a policy option, but as a constitutional imperative flowing from the state's duty to protect life.

Ultimately, it requires embracing a new principle of fundamental justice for our time: cognitive liberty. By recognizing the fundamental right to mental self-determination, we can move beyond the failed logic of prohibition and control. This provides the foundation for a new legal and social paradigm—one where the regulation of substances is guided not by moral panic and a desire to control, but by evidence, compassion, and a profound respect for the autonomy and dignity of every individual. Dismantling the prohibition pattern is not simply a matter of policy reform; it is a constitutional necessity and a defining human rights challenge for this generation.
