## **Introduction: From Wicked Problems to Actionable Insight**

### **The Challenge of Wickedness**

The landscape of public policy is littered with problems that resist conventional solutions. These are not the "tame" problems of mathematics or engineering, which have clear formulations and verifiable answers.1 Rather, they are what design theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber first termed "wicked problems" in 1973: complex, open-ended, and intractable challenges where both the nature of the problem and the preferred solution are intensely contested.1 Wicked problems are defined by a set of ten confounding characteristics. They lack a definitive formulation; the process of defining the problem is synonymous with finding a solution.1 They have no "stopping rule"—there is no inherent logic that signals when the problem is solved, only points at which stakeholders run out of time, money, or patience.1 Solutions are not true or false, but are judged as "good" or "bad" from the differing perspectives and value systems of stakeholders.4 There is no way to test a solution without implementing it, and every implementation is a "one-shot operation" with irreversible consequences, precluding trial-and-error learning.1 Furthermore, every wicked problem is essentially unique, can be considered a symptom of another problem, and the way it is described determines the range of possible solutions.1 This class of problems includes some of the most pressing issues of our time, such as climate change, social inequality, public health crises, and immigration policy.1 The very nature of these problems renders traditional, linear problem-solving methodologies inadequate.

### **The Inadequacy of Standard Responses**

Faced with the ambiguity and complexity of wicked problems, standard public management responses have proven insufficient.3 Traditional regulatory frameworks and market-based solutions, designed for more predictable environments, often fail to grasp the multifaceted nature of these challenges. In the political arena, leaders frequently advocate for ideological "quick fixes," which, due to their simplistic nature, often prove ineffective or even counter-productive, exacerbating the very issues they aim to solve.6 The evidence base for policy-making is inevitably incomplete, subject to value-laden interpretations, and often "cherry-picked" by stakeholders to support preferred positions.6 While collaborative and inclusive approaches are frequently recommended to navigate the multiple interests and complex causalities inherent in wicked problems, the practical difficulties of implementing such approaches successfully are well-documented.6 This reveals a critical and persistent gap between the nature of wicked problems and the conventional tools deployed to address them. The intractability of these issues is not a temporary annoyance but a fundamental feature that demands a new mode of analysis and action.

### **Introducing the Swirl Kernel Framework**

This report introduces the Swirl Kernel, a novel conceptual framework designed to bridge this gap. It offers a systems-based diagnostic and interventional tool tailored specifically for the unique architecture of wicked problems. The framework's central premise is that to effectively intervene in a wicked problem, one must first diagnose and understand the underlying system structure that generates and perpetuates it. The persistence of a wicked problem is not a sign of policy failure in the conventional sense, but rather an indication that the social system in question is successfully achieving an unstated, often perverse, emergent goal. The problem is not that the system is "broken," but that it is powerfully and resiliently "stuck" in a dysfunctional state that serves some unacknowledged purpose.

This understanding is derived from a synthesis of systems theory and public policy analysis. The intractability and resistance to resolution that define wicked problems 3 are, from a systems perspective, the behavioral signature of a system governed by powerful feedback loops.11 A system's structure is the source of its behavior, and persistent behavior patterns are the product of that structure.12 Therefore, the "wickedness" of a problem is not an external quality but an internal, structural property of the social system that produces it. This system has achieved a form of dysfunctional homeostasis, or dynamic equilibrium 13, in which powerful feedback mechanisms actively counteract attempts at change to maintain the familiar, albeit harmful, status quo.15

The Swirl Kernel framework operationalizes this insight. The "Swirl" is the diagnostic component, identifying the self-sustaining, pathological pattern of behavior that defines the wicked problem. The "Kernel" is the interventional component, focused on identifying the high-leverage points within the system's structure where a small shift can produce transformative change. This approach fundamentally reframes the objective from seeking a definitive "solution" to designing a strategic "intervention" within an ongoing, dynamic process.10 It provides a methodology for looking beyond the chaotic surface events of a wicked problem to see the elegant, self-perpetuating logic of the system that lies beneath.

## **Part I: The Architecture of the Swirl Kernel**

### **The 'Swirl' – Diagnosing Dysfunctional Homeostasis in Social Systems**

#### **Defining Social Homeostasis**

The concept of homeostasis, central to physiology, provides a powerful lens for understanding the behavior of social systems. In biology, homeostasis is the self-regulating process by which an organism maintains internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions.14 It involves complex, nonlinear feedback loop mechanisms that counteract disturbances to preserve the system's integrity.14 This principle extends beyond biology to human systems. Any group, from a family to a government agency, develops an equilibrium or a sense of internal balance.15 This social homeostasis is a powerful force; when the familiar balance is disrupted by change, members of the system often experience discomfort and will, consciously or unconsciously, act to restore the familiar patterns, regardless of whether those patterns are functional or destructive.15 A system trying to maintain homeostasis will actively resist change. This "change back" reaction is a predictable response as the system seeks to regain the stability it is accustomed to.15 A wicked problem, therefore, can be understood as a system trapped in a state of dysfunctional homeostasis—a stable, self-regulating equilibrium that is profoundly harmful to its participants or its stated purpose.

#### **The 'Swirl' as a Strange Attractor**

To visualize this state of dysfunctional homeostasis, the framework employs the metaphor of a "strange attractor" from chaos theory.17 In dynamical systems, an attractor is a set of states toward which a system tends to evolve.18 A simple "point attractor" would be a pendulum coming to rest. A "periodic attractor" would be a planet in a stable orbit. A "strange attractor," however, describes a much more complex pattern. The system's behavior is confined within a defined boundary, yet within that boundary, its trajectory is chaotic, locally unpredictable, and never repeats itself exactly.17 The Lorenz attractor, famously shaped like a butterfly, illustrates how a deterministic system can exhibit such chaotic behavior, demonstrating a sensitive dependence on initial conditions.19

This metaphor powerfully captures the dual nature of a wicked problem. From a distance, the problem appears stable and patterned—for example, rates of recidivism, homelessness, or racial disparity in policing remain stubbornly high over decades. This is the boundary of the attractor. Yet, on the ground, the individual events that constitute the problem appear chaotic, random, and disconnected. The system is "attracted" to this overall dysfunctional state.19 Social systems can exhibit various forms of these attractors. For instance, an "Excluded Middle" attractor describes a state where a "hole" exists in the possibility space—certain ideas or solutions are so far outside the system's worldview that they become "unthinkable" and cannot be sustained.17 This corresponds directly to the way a wicked problem's formulation can predetermine and limit its possible solutions.1 The 'Swirl' is the diagnosis of a social system captured by such a strange attractor, endlessly tracing a complex, self-perpetuating pattern of dysfunction.

#### **The Engine of the 'Swirl' \- Reinforcing Feedback Loops**

The mechanism that powers the 'Swirl' and holds the system within its dysfunctional attractor is the reinforcing feedback loop. As described by Donella Meadows, a pioneer in systems thinking, a reinforcing loop is an amplifying, self-multiplying, snowballing process.12 It is a closed chain of causal connections where an action produces a result that, in turn, influences more of the same action, leading to exponential growth or collapse.11 These are the engines of "vicious circles" and "virtuous circles".12 A 'Swirl' is a system dominated by one or more powerful, destructive reinforcing feedback loops. For example, the more soil erodes, the fewer plants can grow to hold the soil, leading to more erosion.21 In a social context, the more financial stress an individual feels, the more they might engage in stress-spending, which increases their debt and thus their financial stress, creating a runaway cycle.21 The consistent, persistent behavior pattern of a wicked problem over time is the primary indicator of an underlying reinforcing feedback loop at work.11

#### **System Archetype: Drift to Low Performance**

A classic and insidious manifestation of a 'Swirl' is the system archetype Meadows termed "Drift to Low Performance".23 This trap occurs when a system's goals or standards are allowed to erode in response to poor past performance. A gap between a goal and the actual state of the system normally creates pressure for corrective action, forming a

*balancing* feedback loop. However, in a drift to low performance, this corrective pressure is relieved not by improving performance, but by lowering the goal itself.25 This creates a powerful

*reinforcing* feedback loop: poor performance leads to lower expectations, which in turn allows for even worse performance, which further erodes expectations.24

Meadows provides vivid examples: a car repair shop that, overwhelmed by demand, lets quality slip and raises prices, eventually becoming as mediocre as its competitors.25 A personal jogging program that slips from a goal of six miles, to four, to two, and finally to zero, with each new low becoming the accepted standard.25 This archetype is particularly dangerous because the degradation is often gradual and goes unnoticed, like the proverbial frog in slowly boiling water.24 People become accustomed to mediocrity, and the performance that once would have caused outrage becomes accepted as normal.25 This is a perfect description of a system finding a stable, homeostatic, but highly dysfunctional equilibrium. It has stopped trying to solve its problem and has instead redefined the problem away. The only way to counter this drift is to hold standards absolute, basing them on the best achievable performance, not the most recent poor performance, thereby maintaining the creative tension needed for improvement.25

The persistence and intractability of a wicked problem can thus be reframed. It is not a sign of a system's weakness or failure, but rather a testament to its *perverse resilience*. The system is not broken; it is incredibly strong and adaptive in its ability to maintain its dysfunctional state. Resilience is a system's ability to recover from perturbation and bounce back to its preferred state, an ability that arises from a rich structure of feedback loops.12 In a 'Swirl', the dominant reinforcing loops create a powerful resilience that actively resists change and works to restore the system to its familiar, harmful equilibrium.15 Any attempt to nudge the system is met with a "change back" reaction as it seeks to regain its dysfunctional homeostasis.15 This means that the very intractability of the wicked problem is a direct measure of the system's resilience. The challenge, therefore, is not to "fix" a broken system, but to find ways to disrupt a highly resilient but undesirable one. Interventions must be powerful enough to overcome this resilience, either by fundamentally weakening the destructive reinforcing loops or by introducing new, stronger balancing loops that can shift the system's attractor to a more desirable state.

### **The 'Kernel' – Identifying and Activating High-Leverage Interventions**

#### **Moving Beyond Parameters**

To disrupt a resilient 'Swirl', interventions must be aimed at points of high leverage. According to Meadows, a system's leverage points—places where a small shift can produce big changes—are often counter-intuitive.28 Most policy efforts focus on low-leverage points: changing parameters, numbers, and the sizes of buffers.23 These include adjusting budgets, hiring more staff, or building more facilities. While these actions may seem direct and substantial, they are typically the least effective ways to change the fundamental behavior of a complex system.23 A system structured to produce a certain outcome will often adapt to and absorb such changes, ultimately neutralizing their impact. For example, simply increasing the budget for a failing program without changing its underlying goals or rules will likely result in a more expensive failure.

#### **The 'Kernel' as a High-Leverage Point**

The 'Kernel' of the framework is defined as a targeted intervention aimed at the most powerful leverage points in a system's structure. Meadows' hierarchy identifies these points, moving from least to most effective 11:

* **The strength of balancing feedback loops:** These are the corrective mechanisms that seek to stabilize a system around a goal. Strengthening a weak or delayed balancing loop can have a significant impact.  
* **The gain of reinforcing feedback loops:** Intervening to reduce the "snowballing" effect of a destructive reinforcing loop can halt a vicious cycle.  
* **The structure of information flows:** Changing who has access to what information can radically alter behavior. Making information more timely, accurate, and widely available is a powerful form of intervention.  
* **The rules of the system:** This includes the incentives, punishments, and constraints that govern behavior. Changing the rules (e.g., performance metrics, contractual obligations) changes the actions people take.  
* **The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure:** Interventions that enhance a system's ability to learn and adapt, fostering self-organization, are highly transformative.12  
* **The goals of the system:** The purpose of a system is a more potent leverage point than any of its functional parts. Changing the overarching goal can cause all the elements and feedback loops below it to realign and behave differently.  
* **The mindset or paradigm out of which the system arises:** This is the highest leverage point. The shared social beliefs and values that underpin the entire system—its goals, structure, rules, and loops—are the most powerful determinant of its behavior. To change the paradigm is to change everything.11

The 'Kernel' is thus an intervention designed to strike at these deeper, structural levels. It is often an informational, relational, or paradigmatic intervention rather than a purely material or financial one. It focuses on restructuring feedback, changing rules, and shifting goals to create the conditions for the system to find a new, healthier equilibrium.

### **The Swirl Kernel Diagnostic Checklist**

To translate the abstract principles of the framework into a practical methodology, the Swirl Kernel Diagnostic Checklist provides a structured, repeatable process for analysis. It is designed to guide an analyst, policymaker, or advocate through a systematic inquiry into the anatomy of any wicked problem, forcing a holistic, systems-level view and preventing the common error of focusing on isolated parts or symptoms.13 By standardizing the diagnostic process, the checklist allows for robust comparison across different social issues and political administrations, creating a baseline against which the impact of interventions can be measured.

## **Part II: Cross-Jurisdictional Test Case – The U.S. Immigration Detention System**

To demonstrate the analytical power of the Swirl Kernel framework, this section applies it to a quintessential wicked problem: the U.S. immigration detention system. This system is a complex, cross-jurisdictional entity involving federal agencies, state and local governments, and a vast network of private corporations. Its persistent issues with mass incarceration, human rights abuses, and fiscal irresponsibility make it an ideal test case for diagnosing a 'Swirl' and identifying potential 'Kernels' for intervention.

### **Mapping the System's Structure and Purpose**

#### **Stated Purpose**

The stated purpose of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency at the heart of the detention system, is to "protect the homeland through criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration".36 Its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was created with a mission focused on national security. Official communications emphasize the detention of individuals who pose a threat to public safety or are a flight risk, and the orderly administration of immigration law.37 The language is one of security, control, and the rule of law.

#### **Revealed Purpose**

However, an analysis of the system's behavior, incentives, and resource allocation reveals a purpose that diverges significantly from the one stated. The system's *revealed* purpose appears to be the maintenance and expansion of a mass detention apparatus, driven by legislative mandates and private financial interests. This is evidenced by three key structural features:

1. **Budgetary Priorities:** Congressional appropriations and agency spending priorities demonstrate an overwhelming focus on detention and removal. Recent legislative proposals, such as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (H.R. 1), have sought to allocate staggering sums—$168 billion on top of an existing $33 billion base—to immigration enforcement, which would triple the overall ICE budget and quadruple its detention budget by 2028\.40 Even before such expansions, immigration enforcement spending dwarfed that of all other federal law enforcement combined, including the FBI, DEA, and ATF.40 This massive allocation of resources reveals a primary systemic goal: to build and operate a vast infrastructure for apprehension and incarceration.41  
2. **The Bed Mandate:** A critical turning point in defining the system's purpose was the introduction of the immigration detention "bed mandate" in 2009\. Through appropriations language, Congress has directed ICE to maintain a certain number of detention beds—initially 33,400 and later 34,000—available on a daily basis.42 While formally removed in 2017, this quota established an artificial floor for the detention system and has continued to serve as a benchmark for funding.45 This provision fundamentally alters the system's logic. The goal shifts from detaining individuals based on case-by-case risk assessments to filling a predetermined capacity. The system's success is no longer measured solely by public safety outcomes but by its ability to meet a numerical, capacity-based target. No other law enforcement agency in the United States is subject to such a statutory quota on detention levels.42  
3. **Private Prison Influence:** The system's revealed purpose is inextricably linked to the influence of the for-profit prison industry. To accommodate the spike in detentions following the bed mandate, the federal government has relied heavily on private corporations like CoreCivic and The GEO Group to build and operate facilities.43 These companies now operate the vast majority of ICE detention beds—an estimated 79% of the daily detained population.46 Their business model is simple: their revenue and profits are directly tied to the number of people detained.47 After the bed mandate was implemented, the profits of these corporations soared.43 To protect this revenue stream, they have spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress, particularly the appropriations subcommittees responsible for the bed mandate language.43 This introduces a powerful non-state actor whose primary goal—profit—has become deeply embedded within the public system's operational logic, creating a powerful constituency for maintaining high levels of detention.

**Table 2: ICE Budgetary Analysis \- Stated Priorities vs. Actual Expenditures (FY2009-Present)**

| Fiscal Year Period | Stated Priority / Mission Statement | Key Budgetary Actions & Allocations | Revealed Priority | Sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2009-2017 (Obama Admin.)** | "Smart, effective immigration enforcement that focuses on public safety, border security and the integrity of the immigration system." | \- Bed mandate introduced (2009), rising to 34,000 beds daily. \- Detention costs taxpayers \~$2 billion annually. \- Private prisons operate over half of detention beds; profits for CCA & GEO Group grow significantly. | Maintain and fill a congressionally mandated detention capacity, fueling private prison industry growth. | 42 |
| **2017-2021 (Trump Admin. 1.0)** | "Protecting the American People from Invasion" / Aggressive enforcement. | \- National bed quota formally removed (2017), but detention numbers surge far beyond it. \- Local "guaranteed minimum" quotas in contracts become more prominent. \- Rapid expansion of 287(g) agreements. | Maximize detention and removal numbers, leveraging private and local partnerships to expand enforcement reach. | 45 |
| **2021-2025 (Biden Admin.)** | "Fair, orderly, and humane immigration system." / End DOJ contracts with private prisons. | \- Executive order to phase out DOJ private prison contracts does *not* apply to DHS/ICE. \- ICE detention populations, after a COVID-19 dip, climb steadily, surpassing previous highs. \- ICE contracts account for \~30% of CoreCivic's revenue. | Continued reliance on the existing mass detention infrastructure, particularly private facilities, despite shifts in rhetoric. | 49 |
| **2025-Present (Trump Admin. 2.0)** | Mass deportation agenda. | \- H.R. 1 proposes \~$168B in new enforcement funding, aiming to triple ICE budget. \- Mandates hiring 10,000 new ICE agents and quadrupling detention budget. \- Rapid expansion of 287(g) program, resurrecting aggressive "task force" model. | Dramatically expand the physical and human capacity of the detention and deportation apparatus to unprecedented levels. | 40 |

### **Identifying the Reinforcing Loops of the 'Swirl'**

The ICE detention system is not merely a linear process but a dynamic 'Swirl' powered by interconnected, self-reinforcing feedback loops. These loops create a system that is powerfully inclined toward expansion and resistant to reform. Applying the diagnostic checklist reveals at least three dominant reinforcing loops.

#### **The Bed Quota Loop (Success to the Successful)**

This loop operates at the highest level of federal policy and funding, creating a powerful incentive structure that drives the entire system. It follows the "Success to the Successful" system archetype, where the winner of a competition is rewarded with the resources to win even more, eventually crowding out all alternatives.11

1. **Action:** Congress, influenced by political pressures and lobbying, includes language in appropriations bills that mandates or strongly encourages ICE to maintain a high number of detention beds (e.g., the 34,000-bed quota).42  
2. **Result:** This mandate becomes a primary performance metric for ICE. The agency is now incentivized to conduct enforcement operations sufficient to fill these beds, ensuring compliance with congressional directives and justifying its budget.45 Detention decisions are no longer based solely on the risk posed by an individual but are now also driven by the need to meet a system-wide capacity target.  
3. **Reinforcement:** The consistently high number of people in detention is then presented back to Congress as evidence that the large bed capacity is necessary to manage the "threat." This justification, amplified by lobbying from private prison corporations whose profits depend on these high numbers 43, secures the continuation or even expansion of the bed mandate in subsequent funding cycles. The "success" of the detention system in filling its beds is rewarded with the resources to maintain or grow that capacity, while alternatives to detention (ATDs), which are more cost-effective and humane, are starved of resources and systematically excluded.42

#### **The 287(g) Enforcement Loop (Decentralized 'Force Multiplier')**

This loop functions as a critical mechanism for feeding the larger detention system. The 287(g) program, named for the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes it, allows ICE to deputize state and local law enforcement officers to perform federal immigration enforcement functions.48 ICE explicitly touts the program as a "force multiplier" that expands its reach.52

1. **Action:** ICE enters into 287(g) agreements with local law enforcement agencies (LEAs), particularly county sheriffs' offices.48 The number of these agreements has expanded dramatically, from 35 at the end of the Obama administration to over 649 by mid-2025 under the second Trump administration.48  
2. **Result:** This decentralizes immigration enforcement, turning routine traffic stops and minor local infractions into gateways to the federal deportation pipeline. Numerous studies and investigations have documented that 287(g) jurisdictions exhibit widespread racial profiling, particularly of Latino communities.53 A 2011 analysis found that half of all detainers issued through the program were for people who had committed only misdemeanors or traffic offenses.53  
3. **Reinforcement:** The vast number of arrests generated by these local partners provides a steady stream of individuals to fill the beds mandated by the first loop. The program's "success," measured in the sheer volume of apprehensions, is then used by ICE and political proponents to justify its continued existence and rapid expansion into new jurisdictions.52 Each new agreement further widens the enforcement net, which in turn captures more individuals, reinforcing the perception that a massive detention infrastructure is necessary.

#### **The Privatization-Profit Loop (Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor)**

This loop reveals the corrosive effect of privatization on public policy, creating a dependency that makes reform nearly impossible. It exemplifies the "Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor" archetype, where an external solution (private prisons) undermines the system's own capacity to solve its problems, leading to an ever-increasing need for the external solution.12

1. **Action:** To meet the demand for detention space created by the bed mandate, ICE contracts with private prison corporations and local jails.43 Crucially, many of these contracts include "guaranteed minimum" or "lockup quota" clauses, which require ICE to pay the contractor for a minimum number of beds (often 80-100% of capacity) regardless of whether they are actually used.43  
2. **Result:** This contractual arrangement creates a powerful, perverse financial incentive. ICE is now fiscally motivated to prioritize filling beds in facilities with these guarantees to avoid paying for empty space and being accused of wasting taxpayer money.43 Detention becomes a tool of contract management. The decision of who to detain and for how long is no longer purely a matter of public safety but is now influenced by the need to satisfy the terms of a private contract.  
3. **Reinforcement:** The guaranteed revenue stream from these contracts makes the immigration detention market immensely profitable and stable for private prison companies.47 This financial strength empowers them to become major political players, spending millions on lobbying and campaign contributions to ensure the continuation of the policies—especially the bed mandate—that guarantee their profits.43 The private "solution" has now created a permanent dependency. The system has shifted the burden of housing detainees to the private sector, but in doing so, has also imported the private sector's goal (profit) into its own core logic, creating a destructive reinforcing loop that actively works against reform.

The interplay of these three loops creates a formidable 'Swirl'. The congressional mandate for beds creates the demand, the 287(g) program acts as a dragnet to supply the bodies, and the privatization loop locks in the financial incentives to ensure the system perpetuates itself, regardless of its human or social cost. The system is not simply implementing a policy; it is a self-organizing, resilient entity geared towards its own growth.

### **The Erosion of Balancing Loops – Secrecy, Impunity, and Silenced Feedback**

A healthy system relies on balancing (or negative) feedback loops to correct errors, adapt to new information, and maintain stability around a desired goal.12 In the ICE detention system, these critical corrective mechanisms have been systematically weakened, severed, or silenced, allowing the reinforcing loops of the 'Swirl' to run unchecked. This erosion of accountability is not an accident but a structural feature of the system.

#### **Corporate and Legal Secrecy Shields**

The deep integration of private corporations into the detention system has created formidable barriers to transparency, effectively building secrecy shields that block the flow of information necessary for public accountability.

* **Contractual Opacity:** When advocates and journalists have used the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain copies of contracts between ICE and private prison companies, the government has frequently argued that crucial details—such as staffing plans, per-diem payment rates, and guaranteed minimums—are "confidential commercial information" exempt from public release.33 While a 2016 federal court ruling rejected this argument in a specific case, the tendency to shield these public-private arrangements from scrutiny persists, creating information black boxes around the expenditure of billions of taxpayer dollars.33  
* **Sealed Settlements and NDAs:** Lawsuits alleging misconduct, abuse, or wrongful death within detention facilities are often resolved through sealed settlements that include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).60 This practice prevents the public, policymakers, and other potential victims from learning the full extent and nature of the systemic problems. Each case is isolated, preventing the accumulation of public knowledge that could form a powerful balancing loop demanding systemic change.  
* **Ineffective Regulatory Frameworks:** While the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) prohibits government contractors from requiring employees to sign internal confidentiality agreements that would restrict them from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse 32, this protection is narrow. It does not cover the full scope of complex contractual and intergovernmental service agreements that characterize the detention system, nor does it prevent the use of sealed settlements in civil litigation. The very structure of privatization creates layers of legal and commercial confidentiality that obscure the system's inner workings from the public it is meant to serve.

#### **Failed Oversight Mechanisms**

The official balancing loops designed to ensure compliance and accountability—congressional oversight and internal agency inspection—have proven to be profoundly ineffective.

* **GAO and OIG Findings:** A consistent stream of reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has documented a chronic lack of meaningful oversight. A 2021 GAO report found that ICE had failed to establish performance goals or measures for the 287(g) program and had no strategic approach to recruiting new partners, instead focusing on signing as many agreements as possible.53 The report explicitly noted that ICE had no formal oversight mechanism for the Warrant Service Officer (WSO) model, which constitutes a large portion of its 287(g) agreements.48 In response, ICE developed internal guidance for WSO oversight reviews, but this was a reactive measure, and its effectiveness remains unproven.65 Earlier GAO reports from 2009 noted that ICE lacked key internal controls and needed to clarify the nature and extent of its supervision over the program.66  
* **Pervasive Transparency Gaps:** Beyond specific programs, government-wide transparency in contracting is poor. GAO has found that billions of dollars in federal spending are not properly reported to public databases like USAspending.gov, and that dozens of federal agencies fail to report their spending data at all.68 This systemic failure of transparency means that even the most basic balancing loop—the public's ability to track how its money is spent—is broken.

#### **The Human Cost as Unheard Feedback**

The most critical, high-fidelity feedback about the state of the detention system comes from the human beings inside it. The documented accounts of abuse, neglect, and death are not mere anecdotes; they are the ultimate data points indicating a system in a state of profound "drift to low performance," where the well-being of individuals is sacrificed to maintain the system's structure. This feedback is systematically ignored, suppressed, or invalidated.

* **Whistleblower Suppression:** Attempts by insiders to create a balancing loop are often met with resistance. Whistleblowers from the Torrance County Detention Facility, a private prison run by CoreCivic, alleged a massive cover-up involving falsified documents to hide chronic understaffing, collusion with a federal inspector, and gross mismanagement of medical care, all with the knowledge of ICE and corporate leadership.71 Another DHS whistleblower, Ellen Gallagher, raised alarms as early as 2014 about the abusive use of solitary confinement on medically vulnerable and mentally ill people, a practice that violated ICE's own directives.72 These reports represent direct feedback about systemic failure, yet the abusive conditions often persist for years.  
* **Invalidation of Lived Experience:** The system is structured to dismiss the testimony of those it detains. Human rights reports from organizations like Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Amnesty International, and the ACLU, along with journalistic investigations, have compiled overwhelming evidence of inhumane conditions. These include punitive use of solitary confinement for periods that constitute torture under international law 73, rampant medical neglect leading to preventable deaths 72, unsanitary cells teeming with pests 75, sexual assault, and retaliation against those who complain.76 When confronted with these accounts, officials often issue blanket denials, dismissing them as "fabrications" 75 or pointing to internal audits that give facilities "superior" ratings even as whistleblowers allege those audits are fraudulent.71 This invalidation severs the most important feedback loop of all, allowing the 'Swirl' to continue its destructive path unimpeded by the reality of its human consequences.

The ICE detention system is a powerful illustration of how a wicked problem can be amplified by its institutional design. It is not merely a government agency executing a controversial policy; it is a complex public-private hybrid system. This hybridization introduces a new, potent goal—profit maximization—into the system's core logic.47 This goal generates its own reinforcing feedback loops (the Privatization-Profit Loop) that interlock with and fuel the public-sector loops (the Bed Quota and 287(g) loops). The drive for profit provides a relentless, powerful energy source for the entire 'Swirl'. Furthermore, the introduction of private actors creates new secrecy shields under the guise of "confidential commercial information," making the hybrid system

*less* transparent and harder to correct than a purely public one would be.33 The "wickedness" of the problem is therefore not just a feature of the policy itself, but is deeply embedded in the very structure of the public-private arrangement designed to carry it out. Any meaningful intervention must address this hybrid structure, not just the actions of the public agency.

**Table 3: Mapping the 287(g) Program \- Agreements, Models, and Documented Issues by State (Illustrative Sample)**

| State | Number of Agreements (as of mid-2025) | Dominant Models | Documented Issues & Concerns | Sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Florida** | 277+ | Task Force, JEM, WSO | State law mandates cooperation. Governor has threatened sheriffs who resist. Expansion into university campuses proposed. | 52 |
| **Texas** | High (exact number varies) | JEM, WSO, Task Force | Proposed state laws to mandate 287(g) agreements. High concentration of private detention facilities. | 56 |
| **Arizona** | Varies; historically significant | Task Force (historically), JEM | Landmark DOJ investigation into Maricopa County Sheriff's Office found pattern of racial profiling of Latinos, leading to termination of agreement. Taxpayers have paid over $300M to address racial profiling. | 52 |
| **North Carolina** | Varies; historically significant | Task Force (historically), JEM | DOJ investigation into Alamance County found discriminatory policing against Latinos. Studies showed Latino drivers up to 10x more likely to be stopped. High costs for localities. | 52 |
| **Georgia** | High | JEM, WSO | State has enacted laws bolstering local-federal cooperation. | 56 |

**Table 4: Documented Human Rights Violations in ICE Detention vs. Official Standards**

| Official ICE Detention Standard / Policy | Documented Violation / Lived Experience | Sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Medical Care:** Detainees shall have access to a continuum of health care services, including screening, prevention, health education, diagnosis, and treatment. (PBNDS 2011\) | \- Widespread medical neglect; 95% of 52 deaths in custody from 2017-2021 were likely preventable with adequate care. \- Whistleblowers report private prison medical directors denying hospital transport requests. \- Detainees report prescriptions going unfilled, life-threatening conditions ignored, and staff assuming medical concerns are fabricated. | 38 |
| **Solitary Confinement ("Segregation"):** To be used as a last resort, for the shortest duration possible, and not for punitive reasons. Special protections for vulnerable populations. (ICE Directive 11065.1) | \- Used punitively for minor infractions ("eating too slowly," "consensual kiss"). \- Average duration of 27 days, with hundreds of placements over 90 days and dozens over a year, meeting the UN definition of torture. \- 50% increase in use on "vulnerable populations" since March 2023; used to punish hunger strikers and those with mental illness. \- Detainees report 24/7 lights, concrete beds, lack of human contact, leading to severe psychological distress and suicide attempts. | 73 |
| **Staffing & Oversight:** Facilities must maintain adequate staffing levels. ICE employs a "robust, multilevel oversight and compliance program." | \- Whistleblowers allege "critical staffing shortages" (only 54% of required positions filled) and falsification of records to hide this from inspectors. \- GAO reports find ICE lacks meaningful oversight mechanisms, especially for WSO program participants. | 38 |
| **Sanitation & Hygiene:** Detainees shall be housed in a safe and sanitary environment. | \- Detainees report cells teeming with mosquitoes, crickets, and frogs; overflowing toilets flooding floors with human waste. \- Reports of worms in food. \- Limited access to showers (sometimes only twice a week or less). | 75 |
| **Grievance Process:** Detainees have the right to file grievances without fear of reprisal. | \- Analysis of 480+ grievances shows only 8% were found in favor of detained people. \- Over 100 grievances detail retaliation for filing, including physical intimidation, sleep deprivation, and placement in solitary confinement. | 76 |

## **Part III: The Swirl Kernel Framework in Practice**

The diagnostic power of the Swirl Kernel framework is only valuable if it leads to more effective interventions. This final part translates the analysis into a practical methodology, focusing on activating new balancing loops and providing a transferable tool for real-world application.

### **The Power of Lived Experience as a Corrective Feedback Loop**

#### **The Argument for Lived Experience as Data**

In a system like the ICE detention network, where official oversight is demonstrably weak 48 and secrecy shields actively block information flow 33, the accounts of those with firsthand involvement—detainees, families, and frontline workers—are not mere anecdotes. They are essential, high-fidelity data. Lived experience, also called lived expertise, provides the ground truth about a system's actual functioning, revealing the chasm between policy and practice.35 When official channels of feedback are broken, lived experience becomes one of the only reliable sources of information about the true state of the system. It is the raw output of the 'Swirl', and ignoring it is a systemic choice that guarantees continued dysfunction.

#### **A High-Leverage 'Kernel' Intervention**

Therefore, a primary 'Kernel' intervention for any wicked problem is the formal, systematic, and empowered integration of lived experience into governance and oversight. This is not about tokenism or collecting stories for reports.35 It is about creating a new, potent

*balancing feedback loop* where one has been deliberately severed or allowed to atrophy. This intervention strikes at multiple high-leverage points in Meadows' hierarchy: it fundamentally alters the structure of information flows, changes the rules of decision-making, and can ultimately shift the goals and paradigm of the system itself.11

#### **Learning from Other Wicked Problems (Child Welfare)**

The child welfare system, another quintessential wicked problem, provides a valuable model for this type of intervention. Faced with its own intractable challenges—including the over-surveillance of poor families, racial disproportionality, and the trauma of family separation 81—child welfare agencies are increasingly recognizing the necessity of moving beyond simple consultation to authentic partnership with those who have lived experience.34

Emerging best practices in this field offer a concrete roadmap. This includes establishing formal Complaint and Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs) that are child-friendly, confidential, and safe.85 It involves creating structures for shared leadership where lived experts are not just guests at the table but help build the table, participating in governance and co-creating solutions from the earliest stages of planning.34 Crucially, this model recognizes that expertise must be compensated; providing contracts and fair payment for time and knowledge is a prerequisite for sustainable partnership.34 By building trust through transparency, acknowledging past harms, and creating open feedback loops, these initiatives are attempting to install the very balancing mechanisms that are missing in systems like ICE detention.34 This demonstrates that integrating lived experience as a corrective feedback loop is not merely a theoretical ideal but an emerging and practical strategy for tackling wicked problems.

### **The Swirl Kernel Ledger – A Tool for Real-Time Application**

To fulfill the need for a practical and testable framework applicable to various social issues, this report culminates in the Swirl Kernel Ledger. The Ledger is a structured, transferable template designed to guide practitioners—be they activists, journalists, policymakers, or internal reformers—in applying the Swirl Kernel framework to any wicked problem. It operationalizes the Diagnostic Checklist, transforming it from a set of questions into a living document for mapping a problem's systemic anatomy and identifying strategic points for intervention. Below is the Ledger template, populated with summary findings from the Part II analysis of the ICE detention system to serve as a practical example.

**Table 5: The Swirl Kernel Ledger \- A Template for Systemic Diagnosis**

| Ledger Section | Guidance | Example: U.S. Immigration Detention System |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Part A: System Definition** |  |  |
| **Wicked Problem Statement** | Concisely define the persistent, intractable problem. | The U.S. immigration detention system's self-perpetuating cycle of mass incarceration, driven by misaligned incentives, resulting in widespread human rights abuses and fiscal irresponsibility. |
| **Stated Goal / Mission** | Identify the official, publicly stated purpose of the system. | To protect national security and public safety through the orderly enforcement of federal immigration laws.36 |
| **Revealed Goal / Purpose** | Based on behavior, incentives, and resource allocation, what is the system *actually* trying to achieve? | To maintain and fill a vast, contractually obligated detention capacity, driven by legislative mandates and the profit motives of private corporations.40 |
| **Part B: The 'Swirl' Analysis (Dominant Reinforcing Loops)** |  |  |
| **Loop 1: The Bed Quota Loop** | Map the primary vicious cycle. What action leads to a result that reinforces more of the initial action? | Map: Congressional Mandate (Bed Quota) → ICE Enforcement to Fill Beds → High Detention Numbers → Justification for Mandate & Lobbying by Profiteers → Stronger Mandate. Archetype: Success to the Successful. Evidence:.42 |
| **Loop 2: The 287(g) Enforcement Loop** | Map a secondary reinforcing loop that feeds or supports the primary loop. | Map: ICE Deputizes Local Police → Increased Arrests (often for minor offenses/racial profiling) → Feeds Detainees into System → Helps Meet Bed Quota → Justifies Program Expansion. Archetype: Force Multiplier. Evidence:.52 |
| **Loop 3: The Privatization-Profit Loop** | Map a third reinforcing loop, often related to financial or political incentives. | Map: ICE Contracts with Private Prisons (with guaranteed minimums) → Financial Incentive to Fill Beds → Profitability for Corporations → Lobbying for Pro-Detention Policies → More Contracts. Archetype: Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor. Evidence:.43 |
| **Part C: Eroded Balances Analysis (Corrective Failures)** |  |  |
| **Failed Balancing Loop 1: Public & Congressional Oversight** | Identify a key corrective mechanism that is supposed to exist. | Mechanism of Failure: Secrecy shields via "confidential commercial information" in private contracts block transparency. GAO reports confirm government-wide spending data is incomplete and unreliable. Evidence:.33 |
| **Failed Balancing Loop 2: Internal Agency Accountability** | Identify another failed corrective mechanism. | Mechanism of Failure: Documented lack of formal oversight for major programs (e.g., 287(g) WSO model). Whistleblower reports of falsified audits and suppressed internal dissent are ignored or retaliated against. Evidence:.48 |
| **Failed Balancing Loop 3: Human Rights & Legal Standards** | Identify a normative or legal check that is failing. | Mechanism of Failure: Lived experiences of abuse are systematically invalidated. Grievance systems are ineffective and lead to retaliation. Sealed settlements in lawsuits prevent public learning and accountability. Evidence:.60 |
| **Part D: 'Kernel' Intervention Identification (High-Leverage Points)** |  |  |
| **Kernel 1 (Information Flow)** | Propose an intervention that targets the flow of information. | Mandate full public transparency of all detention-related contracts, including per-diem rates, guaranteed minimums, staffing plans, and records of abuse. Eliminate the "confidential commercial information" exemption for public-private detention contracts. |
| **Kernel 2 (System Rules)** | Propose an intervention that targets the rules, incentives, or constraints of the system. | Legislate a permanent end to the bed quota and a ban on "guaranteed minimum" clauses in all government detention contracts. This directly attacks the core incentives of the Bed Quota and Privatization-Profit loops. |
| **Kernel 3 (Balancing Loop)** | Propose an intervention that adds or strengthens a corrective feedback loop. | Create and fund a fully independent Civilian Oversight Board for immigration detention with subpoena power, unrestricted facility access, and mandated representation from legal experts, medical professionals, and individuals with lived detention experience. |
| **Kernel 4 (System Goal)** | Propose an intervention that targets the highest leverage point: the system's goal. | Redefine the primary purpose of the immigration custody system in statute from "detention" to "community-based supervision." Tie all federal funding and performance metrics to the goal of minimizing detention, using it only as a last resort for judicially-reviewed, verified public safety threats. |

## **Conclusion: From Analysis to Transformation**

### **Summary of the Framework**

The Swirl Kernel framework offers a new lens for viewing and acting upon the most intractable social issues of our time. It moves beyond treating the symptoms of wicked problems to diagnosing the underlying systemic structures that perpetuate them. By identifying a wicked problem as a 'Swirl'—a state of dysfunctional, self-reinforcing homeostasis metaphorically described as a strange attractor—it reframes the challenge from fixing a "broken" system to disrupting a "stuck" one. The framework then focuses the search for solutions on the 'Kernel'—the high-leverage points within the system's rules, goals, and feedback structures where targeted interventions can catalyze transformative change. It provides a structured, repeatable methodology, embodied in the Diagnostic Checklist and the Swirl Kernel Ledger, for moving from abstract analysis to concrete, actionable insight.

### **The Universality of the 'Swirl'**

While this report has used the U.S. immigration detention system as its primary test case, the dynamics of the 'Swirl' are visible across a wide range of wicked problems, demonstrating the framework's broader applicability.

* **In the Child Welfare System,** a 'Swirl' can be seen in the reinforcing loop between family poverty and state intervention, where poverty is often confused with neglect, leading to family separations that create further trauma and instability, thus increasing the need for services.82 The introduction of for-profit privatization can create a new 'Swirl', where financial incentives to, for example, move children quickly to adoption may conflict with the goal of family preservation, creating a tension between the system's revealed goal (fulfilling contract metrics) and its stated goal (child well-being).89 High workforce turnover driven by massive caseloads creates a "drift to low performance," eroding the quality of care for vulnerable children.81  
* **In the Criminal Justice System,** the 'Swirl' is evident in the "runaway feedback loops" of predictive policing. Biased arrest data is fed into an algorithm, which then directs more police to the same communities; this increased police presence generates more arrests in those communities, which are then fed back into the algorithm, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of criminalization that is divorced from the true underlying crime rate.92 Similarly, mass incarceration is a 'Swirl' powered by policies like mandatory minimum sentencing, which, despite evidence of their ineffectiveness and high cost, create a system geared toward long-term incarceration, which in turn creates barriers to reentry (e.g., joblessness, disenfranchisement) that increase recidivism, "proving" the need for more prisons.94  
* **In the context of Homelessness,** the 'Swirl' is the vicious cycle connecting poverty, housing instability, and criminalization. A lack of affordable housing and stagnant wages pushes people into homelessness.97 Once unhoused, they are subjected to laws that criminalize life-sustaining activities like sleeping in public.99 This leads to fines, arrest records, and incarceration, which create further barriers to securing employment and housing, thus deepening their poverty and prolonging their homelessness in a powerful reinforcing loop.101

### **A Call to Action**

The Swirl Kernel framework is not presented as a final answer or a panacea. It is a tool—a compass for navigating the bewildering territory of wicked problems. Its value lies in its application. Therefore, this report concludes with a call to action for policymakers, advocates, researchers, journalists, and philanthropists to adopt, test, and refine this framework. By applying the Diagnostic Checklist and the Swirl Kernel Ledger to the challenges they face, practitioners can begin to build a shared language and a more rigorous practice of systemic intervention. The goal is to move beyond the cycle of treating symptoms and reacting to crises, and toward a future where we can collectively redesign the systems that shape our lives to be more just, humane, and effective. The 21st century's most vexing problems demand nothing less than a new way of seeing and a new way of acting.
